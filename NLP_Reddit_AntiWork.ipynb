I deleted the messages and blocked the users without replying, but still.  If you're one of those people, I hope your socks get wet while you're out walking.\\n\\nHowever, thank you to ALL of you who were kind, supportive, and wished me luck in confronting my boss and the situation at work; I literally lost count of how many of you were on my side and had ideas on how I could deal with the situation.

I read as many of the comments as I could but there were over 10k!\\n\\nOn to the update.\\n\\n\\\\----------------------\\n\\nI had posted yesterday on my lunch break, and when I came back into work I already had a few good ideas thanks to a bunch of you.  Like several of you recommended, I wanted to get her accusations in writing, so I sent off an email as soon as I sat down after lunch.  I basically played dumb: \\\"Hi, just wanted to double check the rules regarding bringing coffee in from home.  Is this not allowed?  \\\\*I don't recall this being in our employee handbook\\\\* blah blah blah\\\"\\n\\nShe replied about an hour later, saying what she had said earlier: yes, it was grounds for firing since it was \\\"using company property for personal gain\\\" (lolwut) and I should only use the company Keurig cups.  I replied asking if it was considered stealing the company water, and she again said yes, but not if I PAID for the coffee since I was \\\"purchasing it.\\\"\\n\\n(Oh, and a bunch of you also thought she was profiting off the coffee cups, and while your logic was sound, I found out later she has no responsibilities or 'fingers in the pot' regarding the fees from employee break area.  Turns out she really is just a micromanaging asshole.)\\n\\nOnce I got these emails back from her, I went straight in person to my Senior Boss, who outranks everyone in the office.  I asked him if it was true that we were not allowed to bring in our own personal  Keurig cups.  He looked confused and said \\\"No, that's not true at all, I bring in my own sometimes.\\\" He went from confused to shocked when I told him I was being accused of stealing company water while using my own Keurig cups and that I wanted to file an official complaint...and then annoyed when I told him who was accusing me and who I wanted to complain against.  He apologized profusely on behalf of the asshole manager and explained a few things.\\n\\nLong story short: there were MULTIPLE complaints of the same nature against this particular manager, mostly in the vein that she was overstepping the bounds of her duties and threatening to fire people at the slightest whim....which, Senior Boss told me, was NOT her decision to make.\\n\\nSenior Boss apologized again and again, told me that I was absolutely allowed to bring in my own Keurig cups, and that he would be speaking to the other manager in question.  He finished by saying \\\"her behavior will stop, I promise you, and she won't be speaking to you about this again.  Let me know if she brings it up further.\\\"  \\\\*He again repeated that it was not her responsibility or within her duties to fire me.\\\\*\\n\\nI have a very good relationship with my Senior Boss, and he told me that while he would prefer to avoid filing an official complaint, he would understand if I chose to and would draw up the paperwork.  I told him that as long as no one else was accusing me of theft and that my job wasn't actually in jeopardy (it wasn't, he kept telling me), I wouldn't file a complaint...ONLY if the asshole manager apologized in person.\\n\\nI got a very tight-lipped face-to-face apology about 2 hours later from the asshole manager.  I told her how insulting it was to be accused of theft, especially over something so incredibly stupid as a \\\\*single cup of water.\\\"\\\\*  I told her I didn't want to talk about it further, and that I wasn't going to hold it over her head as long as she treated me fairly going forward.  I told her I would not be lodging a complaint, but if I felt like I was being unjustly accused of something in the future from her, I'd have those emails she so conveniently sent me as evidence that she didn't know what she was talking about.\\n\\nLike I said, I have a very good relationship with Senior Boss and I've been at my current company for 5 years...I'm not worried.  I do genuinely want to thank you all again who commented yesterday, offering me support, ideas, and help. That's one of the many reasons I came to this subreddit in the first place!\\n\\nI probably will end up deleting this post in a day or so, I'm not sure if that's against the rules of this subreddit or not. I very rarely post on Reddit anyway, and I honestly posted yesterday just to vent...today included.\\n\\nThanks for coming to my TED talk.  Get everything your boss says in writing!

On Reddit for a while, but mostly for memes and seen this subreddit on main page for a while and decided to check it out.\\n\\nGuys, I am purely shocked. You should really be on barricades right now with these working conditions. Let me explain why is that in simple facts. In Russia, under mafia rule, cleptocracy and small bussinesses hard to impossible to survive, every single worker from dishwasher and cashier to top managers has following rights:\\n\\n1. 14 days vacation every six months. 21 days for dangerous professions, two months for school teachers (logically summer holiday). Unused vacation days are paid in cash according to your salary during last 6 months of your employment if you leave.\\n2. Sick leaves are mandatory to be paid. Companies MUST pay to social security fund and you get paid sick leaves, from 20 to 100% of your salary depending on years you worked at one place. Also, most companies offer two 100% paid weeks for sick leaves per year after 1 year.\\n3. All night shifts are paid x1.5, no matter what. All shifts during your free days are paid X2 or exchanged to free day whenever you want.\\n4. If you are a pregnant, you get 70 fully 100% paid days before the child born and 70 days after, 140 days in total.\\n5. In addition to number 4, one of parents can take 1.5 years (right, YEARS) of \\\"take care of children\\\" vacation and receive 40% of the salary. The employer is not allowed to fire you during that period and not allowed to fire you immediately after.\\n6. If your position is cut and you are fired cause of that, you must receive x3 of your monthly salary as a bonus.\\n7. You cannot be fired without agreement with you for other reasons, unless you have formal complaints in your personal formal governement \\\"labor book\\\" (which is extremely rare case). All complains must comply with labor laws. If you are fired without such complaints, or if they are not strong enough, the labor inspection will go in a court for you and make the company take you back + pay full salary for the period you were \\\"fired\\\" + compensation. 80% of court cases are won by the labor inspection.\\n\\nLike guys, that's the basic shit. You are the richest contry of the world. Your companies are INSANELY rich and they threat their workers like shit.

I quit and needed something fast at night while I look for something better during the day. \\n\\nIt was a data entry position, meaning I get an email containing the details of an order and proceeding to input the information into our system. \\n\\nRight after my training I knew this is something Autohotkey can do, I don't know to code that well, so I went to a freelancer website to hire a guy to develop the code, it cost me a two-month salary....\\n\\nI just had to input how many orders I want to process per hour, since day 1 I was working from home because the company did not want to pay for transport or cleaning during the graveyard shift. \\n\\nFor the first 2 years, I would check if there was something the code cannot do (usually took me less than 5 minutes) and then I would let the computer running and watch movies, go to bed, sometimes I'd even go out. Then I added those functions to the code as well. \\n\\nI was doing such a remarkable job I was offered promotions a few times, new positions during the daytime that I'd reject stating I'm a very introverted person that enjoys this type of position.  \\n\\nEventually, I got another job, better paid, but there was no reason for me to quit where I was working. For my data entry job, I could spend months without having anybody reach out to me. \\n\\nSometimes some co-workers will try to match my order entry quota, which would make me open the code, and change an 8 to 9 to increase my production and keep myself on top. I'd change the numbers regularly \\\"just in case\\\" but nobody even noticed. \\n\\nI even got 2 salary raises at some point for never missing a day, and being the top producer in my 3 people department, to which I corresponded by changing the 9 and switching it to an 11 or 10 on some days. \\n\\nMy end. \\n\\nIt took them 4 years to develop new software that will replace my data entry position.

I had a revelation shorty after the pandemic started. \\n\\nMy job was now to be done remotely - from home. Of course, it would be impossible to have a second full time job if I had to still go into the office but now that my home is my office I decided to find multiple jobs because why not.

Then a month went by, two months\\u2026and I had been working both jobs no problem, collecting two paychecks. I can easily do the work I need to do within the first hour and then just follow up as the day goes on - total at desk time would be around 5 hours for both jobs.

I went to DD because the other option was Starbucks and they\\u2019re not my favorite either though knowing more about the low pay of DD workers I\\u2019m going to try and find somewhere else to hit up. Lastly, they were very understaffed and I took her \\u2018$25/hr\\u2019 comment as they wouldn\\u2019t have a staff shortage if they paid better. I do know they should be paid more as DD is a multi-billion dollar company who can afford it by selling $5 cups of coffee\",\"I'm an autistic teacher applying for jobs working with autistic students.

My friend got off work the other night and clocked out at 11 and he was forced to stay in the store until 12am because the other workers were still busy cleaning or working on inventory. He told me he asked my boss to unlock the door for him and my boss was just saying \\\"You have to wait for everyone else/ you really can't wait an extra few minutes?\\\" Sometimes they will eventually let you out and unlock the door for you but act like it's so out of their way and an annoyance to do so.

I told them I have a doctor's appointment that's out of town (about 2 1/2 hours one-way) that I'd made 4 months ago with a specialist but I could come early like 8/9 or another day.

I said no that it's a specialist that I've been scheduled to see for over 4 months now and that's when she got a bit of an attitude and said \\\"well, just make sure when you come in on Wednesday at 1pm to bring a doctors note\\\" and I replied with \\\"see you Wednesday\\\" and hung up so she didn't even ask if I could make it to the second date/time she set up.\",\"I have a weird long name, I'm racially mixed and my name sucks nobody can pronounce it and employers think I'm not from here.

Anyways I have heard from my sister or my niece a lot of complaints about her job in terms of management and coworkers, who are mostly men from 40-65. It was the main topic of conversation at the family Xmas-eve dinner.\\n\\nSome things that came up at X-mas eve dinner. She says she has complained to HR multiple times about the below and that they just tell her \\\"We will look into it\\\", and nothing ever happens.\\n\\n1. Management often tell her comments, usually negative, due to her appearance. Comments such that she should get a boob job in order to \\\"improve her performance at the reception desk\\\", or that she should come to work wearing a \\\"tighter dress\\\" to \\\"highlight that figure for us\\\".  My niece is a plain-Jane type that prefers to be well covered up at all times, so obviously these comments are quite offensive for her.\\n2. Her boss (\\\\~50ish) frequently calls her the wrong name. He dislikes her \\\"ethnic\\\" sounding name and calls her the white-washed version of her name. Whenever she complains about it his attitude towards my niece is \\\"tough shit, I'm your boss\\\".\\n3. Has noticed that management was not paying her for her overtime hours, though she's an hourly employee and legally guaranteed time and a half for overtime hours.\\n4. Was offered a promotion with the condition of going out to dinner with her boss. She refused the promotion and her boss goes around the office trash talking her performance because he didn't get his way.\\n5. Boss makes sexist comments that women are incapable of holding positions of authority in the workplace and make \\\"good assistants and secretaries\\\" because women \\\"are designed to serve and obey\\\". And that she should be grateful for \\\"this opportunity at our business\\\".\\n\\nIt all came to a head when there was a office meeting as a team building exercise for the holidays or something. Upper management, the CEO, and her boss, and a number of other people in the office were there at the meeting. At that meeting her boss put his hand on her shoulder while she was sitting at the table and he was standing behind her, and he made negative remarks about my niece's workplace performance. He stated she needs to strive to be \\\"more compliant in life and never say no at work\\\" and needs to follow the example of his obedient stay-at-home Thai wife if my niece wants to have any chance of receiving a bonus or raise next year (this year she didn't get a raise).\\n\\nMy niece stood up, slapped her boss full force in the face and screamed at him some choice words about being a sexist abusive pervert and shouted \\\"I QUIT\\\" and stormed out.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nUDPATE: I've read some replies on here and a number of people have some good points that I will pass along to my niece the next time I speak to her. Namely, that by slapping her boss she may have opened herself to a potential assault lawsuit, and that she should speak to a lawyer that practices in the state of Oklahoma (where she lives) about the sexual harassment and missed OT pay as soon as she is able to do so. And hopefully whatever attorney she talks to will be able to direct her to whatever legal options she has available.

Looking back now, I think this was one of the few epiphany moments I've had in my life; a definitive moment I can fully realise in retrospect. At the time, I didn't understand the impact it had on me.\\n\\n\\nI was maybe 19 when I started tending bar at this fancy hotel. I'd worked before; the usual \\\"no skills, all enthusiasm\\\" gigs a young guy could pick up: door-to-door knives salesman, low-level construction jobs, product re-sale, etc. Anyway, it's not a fancy brand name chain hotel for the uber-rich and policital elite. Nah, this was a hotel-bar-restaurant combo in a historical building that was previously some old rich dudes mansion house back in 1608 or whatever. I got in right before the ownership changed and the new boss wanted to make it an expensive and exclusive experience.\\n\\n\\nIt took time relaunching this old hole-in-the-wall bar into a \\\"prestigious getaway opportunity\\\" and \\\"fine-dining cocktail bar\\\" but I was commited to it. I worked my ass off chipping in with the redecoration, studying mixology in my spare time, and trying to have an input where possible. Young and optimistic, I believed this new boss's vision, and that I'd be the symmetrical-toothed Tom Cruise serving drinks. \\n\\n\\nThe takeover was a family affair. The new owner had employed as much of his family as he could. Sons, daughters, in-laws, cousins. Only in \\\"consultancy\\\" roles, though.. None of the heavy lifting and shit flipping that I was doing. What's the harm in helping out though, right? I'll throw a couple laundry loads in, mop up some vomit, and clean a fryer or two, sure. \\n\\nSee, these little tasks were to be expected now: I'd been promoted!! \\nThat is, \\\"promoted\\\" (without any pay increase) to running bar and hiring my own choice of staff to tend it. Well, provided they were young women with big boobs. That was my boss's final word on anyone I put forward.\\n\\n\\nSometimes, you can get so caught up in something that you don't even realise it. Sometimes the slope you're steadily sliding down gets a little steeper without you even seeing. That's how I'd describe those next couple years. Little things making their way in so slowly that I didn't even realise it at the time.\\n\\nI was living at the hotel for up to 2 weeks at a time while the owner went on vacations. I guess I ran a hotel now? Even though I never got promoted... The 16 hour shifts were creeping up in frequency. At some point, I'd started smoking. \\n\\nThe clocking-in machine only worked in 15 minute increments, and you could easily lose yourself 14 minutes of pay if you didn't know that. 14 minutes of pay each time you clocked out, sometimes multiple times per shift. And you were told to clock out if it was quiet. I'd lost numerous hours before I had even noticed. I made sure to quietly tell all my new hires about it though. It didn't help much; I later found out the boss was cutting 15% from everyones pay anyway. \\n\\n\\nI'd already pulled 60 hours Monday to Friday, putting in extra hours for staff quitting (big red flag I was stupid enough to miss), so I was looking forward to sleeping all day Saturday ready for a wedding shift on Sunday. (A wedding shift was typically 16 hours at a minimum.)\\n\\n\\nI woke up to pee at noon on Saturday and saw 6 missed calls on my phone. Weird. There was a text message from my boss: \\\"Where the fuck are you? Started prepping for wedding shift and you're not here!!\\\" I honestly thought I'd slept from Friday until Sunday and started to panic, thinking I was late for work. I checked my phones date three times, and a paper calendar twice. Finally convinced it was still Saturday, I replied, \\\"haha relax man, its saturday. i'll see you tomorrow.\\\"\\n\\n\\nBig mistake. Boss replied, \\\"We have double weddings this weekend and you're on schedule all weekend. Not the time for jokes. You need to get here NOW.\\\" My heart is racing, because my mind is telling me I'm incompetent, that I'm stupid, that I've misread my schedule. I check my phone for the photo of the schedule from the day it was posted. My name isn't on for Saturday. I text my boss.\\n\\n\\nThe reply comes in seconds. It's a photo of the same schedule but with my name on it for Saturday. It's written in a different colour. I try to reason with my boss that my name must have been added without my knowledge. He tells me to always check the rota every day. \\n\\nDefeated, I apologise and rush in to work. \\n\\n\\nWith two staff short, it's a gruelling shift. My boss is contributing by walking among us and mentioning how shit we are, and how we're all too slow and underperforming. All breaks are cancelled so we don't fall behind any further. I'm running between tending bar and serving meals and constructing outdoor furniture both before and after the ceremony. Every time I pass through the indoor bar, I catch the boss's daughter and her friend sat at the bar loudly stating how young people are lazy and don't want to work. She's 3 years older than me, vibing on her daddy's money. Every time I pass through the outdoor bar garden to serve drinks, my boss is there schmoozing with some older guys about how he's a visionary who single-handedly created this beautiful and exclusive venue for upstanding folk, and runs his businesses so successfully. \\n\\n\\nI was dumb and I was desparate. That's all I can say for how I ended up there and why I stayed there. It's a lot easier for me to sit here and see all of these red flags waving in my face so much that I can barely type. But at the time, my optimistic little dumbass self didn't see all these things mounting up. \\n\\nOr maybe, subconsciously, at that point some part of me did. \\n\\n\\nThe shift was closing at 3AM with my drunk boss becoming belligerent from having his ego stroked all night. I hadn't even left yet to go home and he came at me loud in front of all the staff about me \\\"being late today\\\" and that I'd better be on time for Sunday's wedding. \\n\\nIt was already Sunday. The wedding was due for 12 noon. He wanted me back for prep from 8:30AM \\n\\nI was tired, man. So damn tired. I joked that if he'd shut up and let me go home, the sooner I can sleep and come back. Well oh shit, did he not like that...\\n\\n\\nThis dude flew off the fucking handle at me, straight into a drunken fit of rage and spittle about how he's created an empire and I'll never do shit! He's such an elite and do you think people like me will ever be like him?!\\n\\n\\nHe concluded by getting right up in my face in front of everyone else, his pointed finger stabbing at my cheek. He growled at me through gritted teeth, \\\"Do you know who I am?\\\" \\n\\nClosing my eyes, I can see it in my mind right now, just as I saw it then: his beetroot red face, the beaded sweat on his forehead, the clench in his jaw, and even the throb of that thick vein in his forehead. \\n\\n\\nI took a deep breath. His eyes lit up, ready for a challenge. \\n\\n\\nI breathed out a slow sigh... \\\"I wish I didn't.\\\" \\n\\n\\nThat was it. That was all I had the energy for.\\n\\n\\nHe clearly hadn't expected such a reply and didn't know how to respond. The moment hung in the air for a second and I took that opportunity to leave. I switched my phone off as soon as I'd left the building. I went home, and slept. I mean, for the first time in a long time, I properly slept. Undisturbed and peaceful. \\n\\n\\nLate Sunday evening I switched my phone on again, to a myriad of texts. What began with a reassurance that I was an ungrateful piece of shit gave way to a hungover apology, several pleas to return, a promise to change, and a swift loop back to telling me I'll never amount to anything. \\n\\n\\nI blocked his number, and took 3 months off to spend my Summer reading in the sun.\\n\\n.\\n\\n\\n\\nEDIT: Shoutout and love to my people in r/kitchenconfidential\",\"So, they don't want us talking wages, huh?

But when the young white collar worker is a pretty blonde girl, all of that evaporates and not only do we hate her and hold her accountable for Uber\\u2019s abuses of their drivers, but she must\\u2019ve only been hired for her ass anyway. \\n\\nThat girl probably makes $90k tops in an expensive city.

The people being openly and flagrantly bigoted and turning off large swaths of the population from getting involved are the ones doing that, and as you can see in the comments, a lot of people were thinking the same thing.

They do fairly well, over the last few years the company has averaged 15 to 20 new builds a year. My uncle is the majority owner and, according to my wife, made nearly 10 mil this year alone. My Wife and I lost our house a few years ago in a wild fire so we moved back to my home town and she took this job in early 2019. We live in one of the most expensive counties in California. \\n\\nHer job:\\n\\nAs time goes on she has been given more and more responsibilities and now basically runs the entire thing. She schedules everyone and everything, she answers the phones, does pay roll, is the accountant, does all the tax stuff, is the one that does interviews for new hires and is hired to clean the entire office every Saturday. If it needs to be done in the office it\\u2019s probably her job. She gets paid $21 an hour but does the work of 3 people and works non stop. We also have a 1 year old at home so we\\u2019re constantly stressed with how much both of us need to work just to get by. He boss (my uncle) is a f**king dick. He is constantly demeaning my wife, every time my wife asks for a raise or time off he throws a huge fit and makes her feel like a POS just for asking for a day off. \\n\\nLast night (Dec 23) she had her Christmas party, and she planned the entire thing. There was a venue, catering, decorations and company gifts to give out. All of which she planned for free on her own time because her boss said it was critical. He would call at 9 pm asking if catering was figured out expecting her to answer. Once she was putting our daughter down for bed and ignored one of his calls and he lost his mind the next morning. Back to the party, Her boss gave presents to every employee, all of the general laborers got new dewalt power tools, like drills, impactors and orbital palm sanders. The partners got massive checks and some others got gift cards. \\n\\nTowards the end he gave a big speech in which he addressed everyone individually and gave a little speech talking about why he appreciates them and how great they all are. I was waiting for my wife\\u2019s name to come up but it never did, at the end of the speech he says alright that\\u2019s everyone and I said what about [wife\\u2019s name] and he said oh ya she\\u2019s a special employee and ended the speech. My wife Christmas present was the left overs from the catering. I\\u2019m not kidding, we got the left overs. At the end of the party my wife approached my uncle and told him she won\\u2019t be coming back in January 1st. She is constantly abused in that office and it\\u2019s clear he boss doesn\\u2019t give a shit about the work she does. She worked non stop this year and might have made 40k, he made almost 250x that this year and gave her the left overs.\\n\\nEdit: To clarify we have talked to him a few times before about his behavior and it has been the highlight of several family fights but we agreed the best thing for now is to just move on and separate him from our life.\\none more clarification: my dad is a nice guy and wouldn\\u2019t say or do thing like that to my wife. It\\u2019s my uncle who is the boss and I\\u2019m general just sucks.\\n\\nEdit 2: Wow this post really blew up! I won\\u2019t be able to respond to everyone but I\\u2019ll try to address some things I\\u2019m seeing in the comments. My dad is def an enabler, it\\u2019s disappointing to me to see that my dad can watch that behavior and not say anything. I\\u2019ve addressed it multiple times and still nothing changes. It\\u2019s difficult to just confront someone that\\u2019s family but multiple times I have confronted my uncle about the way he treats my wife and others in the office, I\\u2019ve tried everything short of physically fighting him. 21 an hour may seem high but the median household value in our area is well over 1 mil so her 40k a year barely covers our rent (3k a month) and my income covers everything else. We decided we\\u2019re moving next year and I\\u2019m confident she will be able to find a great job where ever we end up. Thanks for all the holiday wishes I hope everyone\\u2019s Christmas is great!\",\"Meme: Nicolas Gonzalez\\n@NicoSGonzalez\\n\\\"You don't need a union because\\nwe're a family here.\\\"\",\"I automated my job over a year ago and haven't told anyone.\\nI saw some similar posts to this so I thought I'd jump on the bandwagon.\\n\\nI work for a mid-size lawfirm that hired me as an IT specialist to handle all of their digital evidence for trials. The law-firm was in the process of changing their evidence managing system to Cloud based and wanted me to to be the only person with admin access to the Cloud, everyone else would be limited to view only and would work on a local network drive. Sounds great, but I quickly realized this was the only task they expected me to perform in my 8-hour shift. This was in no way an 8-hour job, so I was stuck pretending to work at the office most of the time.\\n\\nThen COVID happened and I was asked if there was any way I could work from home. I set up a remote workstation, tunneled it to my house, and that's when the real fun began. In about a week I was able to write, debug, and perfect a simple script that performed my entire job. It essentially scans the on-site drive for any new files, generates hash values for them, transfers them to the Cloud, then generates hash values again for fidelity (in court you have to prove digital evidence hasn't been tampered with). I clock in every day, play video games or do whatever, and at the end of the day I look over the logs to make sure everything ran smoothly... then clock out. I'm only at my desk maybe 10 minutes a day.\\n\\nFor a while I felt guilty, like I was ripping the law-firm off, but eventually I convinced myself that as long as everyone is happy there's no harm done. I'm doing exactly what they hired me to do, all of the work is done in a timely manner, and I get to enjoy my life. Win win for everyone involved. Plus, I've already decided that if they ever try to get rid of me I'll just get rid of the script. I'm running it on equipment that I own so if they lose me, they lose the work. Creating my own job security.\\n\\nEdit: Wanted to answer a few questions I've been getting.\\n\\nHow much am I getting paid? Just shy of 90k. I think I'm doing alright.\\n\\nWhat work did they hire me to do? Sorry if it wasn't clear. The firm gets thousands of digital documents, photos, etc on a daily basis. All of this goes on a local drive. My job is to transfer all of these files to the Cloud and then verify their fidelity.\\n\\nWhy do they think this is an 8-hour job? Before they hired me they were struggling to keep up with things. Employees submit a spreadsheet of all the files they've placed on the local drive at the end of the day. Then the admin manager would check the spreadsheet and manually drag and drop the folders/files into the Cloud. I still receive the spreadsheet every day and it's what I use to verify my logs.\\n\\nWhy am I lazy / why am I wasting my life? I don't feel like I am. I do have a passion project that I work on during the day, but it's not relevant to the discussion. Hence the \\\"whatever\\\" portion of \\\"play video games or do whatever.\\\"\\n\\nWhy did I feel guilty, they're lawyers lol? I know it doesn't fit most posts here, but I don't hate my boss. He's actually really nice, albeit not tech savvy at all. I don't actually work with or see the lawyers, I fall under administration since they don't have an IT department.\\n\\nWhat code language am I using / how can you do this? The script is in batch with some portions of powershell. The base code is fairly simple and most of it came from Googling \\\".bat transfer files\\\" followed by \\\".bat how to only transfer certain file types\\\" etc. The trick was making it work with my office, knowing where to scan for new files, knowing where not to scan due to lag (seriously, if you have a folder with 200,000 .txt files that crap will severally slow down your scans. Better to move it manually and then change the script to omit that folder from future searches)\\n\\nWhy don't you sell it and make bank? Please understand that this is not some high end program that's worth millions. This is a few lines of code written in notepad. It only has value in this situation because the office has no technical skills. This is the type of script people put on github with a $5 price tag linked to their PayPal.\\n\\nEdit 2: One more edit to answer a few more things.\\n\\nDon't delete the script due to legal reasons. I agree. I checked my employee contact and there is no IP agreement in there so I thought I'd be safe, but it's probably better if I don't try my luck.\\n\\nHow are you using your own equipment? Short answer, the local drive is theirs, the Cloud drive is theirs, the VPN is theirs. The PC that I bought with my own money specifically for this task only runs the script. There is no work files or evidence being stored on my PC. The script is literally the only thing on the PC other than the OS. Carpenters might buy their own tools because they know exactly what they need and what works for them. I bought my own PC for the same reason.\\n\\nIt can't be this simple / this is fake because you aren't doing blah blah. You're right, it's not this simple. There are more steps involved in the script and it performs functions I haven't discussed. Discussing these functions would be more likely to give away my location. The core of the script, transfer and hash, is accurate. It's the extra steps I take that are specific to my office that I'm leaving out.\\n\\nYes, I saw the Newsweek article. No, I'm not worried.\\n\\nThanks for reading.\",\"I hear about the upcoming ten day strike starting on Black Friday and I hope everyone here is ready to seriously do it. \\n\\nPersonally I am sick of choosing between eating, shelter and DRIVING TO WORK even though I work 60 hours a week, have a bachelors degree and twelve years of experience.

About an hour goes by and I still haven\\u2019t seen Brad, which is unusual because he usually walks around talking to people, well all day really, but particularly in the morning. About two hours in I start talking to one of my fellow employees who I\\u2019m closest with (shoutout K, I know you\\u2019ll see this) and she tells me how apparently Brad\\u2019s just stayed in his office all day not really talking to anyone.

I didn\\u2019t tell her that I was the one who posted it, but when she sees this I guess she\\u2019ll figure it out. \\n\\nAnyways I feel like he definitely had to have seen it, because I don\\u2019t know what else could be causing him to act this way. I kind of feel bad, because quite honestly I never expected him to see this or realize it\\u2019s about him.

I was also accused of making this about myself for some reason and I never once said I wanted to be a leader. The backlash has just been way too strong even after the suggestions in this thread pointed towards organizing in some way or fashion. I suggested a transparent and public Discord chat for people to discuss the IDEA because that seemed to be what the majority were speaking to. A lot of people liked that idea and DM'd me. Then I was just trashed in the comments for ever being involved in this or thinking about organizing messaging because it would inherently \\\"hurt antiwork.\\\" Because that's the **LAST** thing I want to do, I'm going to back off from this.

You need to give us space while we try to do our jobs.\\n\\nIn contrast, if an elderly person wearing a mask comes and ask me to help them with something, I will drop what I'm doing and help them find it, as I walk through the horde of mouthbreathers... leaving a rancid trail of farts in my wake.\\n\\nWho else fucks with maskless customers at a grocery store?\\n\\nEdit: I am a lowly Kroger Associate with Covid scheduled to work on Monday.

No wonder we can't keep our schools open.\\n\\nEdit 3: Imagine how long it takes an understaffed store to break down the equipment and sanitize our workstations by the end of our shifts. Managers call in workers from other stores and clean up before corporate shows up for an inspection. Trust me, you don't want to eat anything from the meat department. Have you ever read The Jungle? I've found curdled milk in dairy. New hires take up to 4 hours to work dairy carts or just leave them in an aisle if they get pinged to work in another department. That is two hours outside of the basic food safety zone. I am surprised that there has not been a salmonella outbreak in the produce department. Did I mention that almost nobody is trained to do work in another department and we're shuffled around the store when another employee calls in sick? We do not know what we're doing. It is reckless to keep these stores running at this point. Employees should NOT be working some of these jobs by themselves.\\n\\nEdit 4: Good luck finding groceries next week guys.

The law-firm was in the process of changing their evidence managing system to Cloud based and wanted me to to be the only person with admin access to the Cloud, everyone else would be limited to view only and would work on a local network drive. Sounds great, but I quickly realized this was the only task they expected me to perform in my 8-hour shift. This was in no way an 8-hour job, so I was stuck pretending to work at the office most of the time. \\n\\nThen COVID happened and I was asked if there was any way I could work from home. I set up a remote workstation, tunneled it to my house, and that's when the real fun began. In about a week I was able to write, debug, and perfect a simple script that performed my entire job. It essentially scans the on-site drive for any new files, generates hash values for them, transfers them to the Cloud, then generates hash values again for fidelity (in court you have to prove digital evidence hasn't been tampered with).  I clock in every day, play video games or do whatever, and at the end of the day I look over the logs to make sure everything ran smoothly... then clock out. I'm only at my desk maybe 10 minutes a day.  \\n\\nFor a while I felt guilty, like I was ripping the law-firm off, but eventually I convinced myself that as long as everyone is happy there's no harm done. I'm doing exactly what they hired me to do, all of the work is done in a timely manner, and I get to enjoy my life. Win win for everyone involved. Plus, I've already decided that if they ever try to get rid of me I'll just get rid of the script. I'm running it on equipment that I own so if they lose me, they lose the work. Creating my own job security.\\n\\nEdit: Wanted to answer a few questions I've been getting. \\n\\n1. How much am I getting paid? Just shy of 90k. I think I'm doing alright. \\n\\n2. What work did they hire me to do? Sorry if it wasn't clear. The firm gets thousands of digital documents, photos, etc  on a daily basis. All of this goes on a local drive. My job is to transfer all of these files to the Cloud and then verify their fidelity. \\n\\n3. Why do they think this is an 8-hour job? Before they hired me they were struggling to keep up with things.  Employees submit a spreadsheet of all the files they've placed on the local drive at the end of the day. Then the admin manager would check the spreadsheet and manually drag and drop the folders/files into the Cloud. I still receive the spreadsheet every day and it's what I use to verify my logs. \\n\\n4. Why am I lazy / why am I wasting my life? I don't feel like I am. I do have a passion project that I work on during the day, but it's not relevant to the discussion. Hence the \\\"whatever\\\" portion of \\\"play video games or do whatever.\\\"\\n\\n5. Why did I feel guilty, they're lawyers lol? I know it doesn't fit most posts here, but I don't hate my boss. He's actually really nice, albeit not tech savvy at all. I don't actually work with or see the lawyers, I fall under administration since they don't have an IT department. \\n\\n6. What code language am I using / how can you do this? The script is in batch with some portions of powershell. The base code is fairly simple and most of it came from Googling \\\".bat transfer files\\\" followed by \\\".bat how to only transfer certain file types\\\" etc.  The trick was making it work with my office, knowing where to scan for new files, knowing where not to scan due to lag (seriously, if you have a folder with 200,000 .txt files that crap will severally slow down your scans. Better to move it manually and then change the script to omit that folder from future searches) \\n\\n7. Why don't you sell it and make bank? Please understand that this is not some high end program that's worth millions. This is a few lines of code written in notepad. It only has value in this situation because the office has no technical skills. This is the type of script people put on github with a $5 price tag linked to their PayPal. \\n\\n\\nEdit 2: One more edit to answer a few more things. \\n\\n1. Don't delete the script due to legal reasons.  I agree. I checked my employee contact and there is no IP agreement in there so I thought I'd be safe, but it's probably better if I don't try my luck. \\n\\n2. How are you using your own equipment? Short answer, the local drive is theirs, the Cloud drive is theirs, the VPN is theirs. The PC that I bought with my own money specifically for this task only runs the script.  There is no work files or evidence being stored on my PC. The script is literally the only thing on the PC other than the OS.  Carpenters might buy their own tools because they know exactly what they need and what works for them. I bought my own PC for the same reason. \\n\\n3. It can't be this simple / this is fake because you aren't doing blah blah. You're right, it's not this simple. There are more steps involved in the script and it performs functions I haven't discussed. Discussing these functions would be more likely to give away my location. The core of the script, transfer and hash, is accurate. It's the extra steps I take that are specific to my office that I'm leaving out. \\n\\n4. Yes, I saw the Newsweek article. No, I'm not worried. \\n\\nThanks for reading.\",\"lf paying a cashier a living wage will make prices go up.

I have yet to hear of a country that requires such bullshit. So \\\"but here it goes both ways\\\" doesn't really mean anything.** \\n\\nYes, sometimes you are obligated to stay for \\\\~2weeks after handing in your notice. 99 times out of 100 via mutual agreement you can just fuck off on the spot. Everyone's happy. If there's any spite in the air, employers don't want that spiteful employee to linger any longer than absolutely necessary.\\n\\nNo, taxes aren't absurd. My highest tax bracket at above median wage (3.2k) was 17%. It varies as taxes do.\\n\\nYes, you can move to Finland. How ? Idk, google it.\\n\\nAnd finally, no, I don't think employers should have the right to fire/\\\"let go\\\" employees on the spot because they feel like it. We're humans, not pawns. Losing a job without warning is absolutely devastating for so many people especially in a country where the safety network is quite poor. If work slows down the employer should've built their business on a sustainable base that doesn't crumble in a week if there's a bit of a quiet period. It is not the employees fault that your businessmodel is unsustainable.\\n\\nHave a good one guys. Unionize people. Make some noise.

Well, I got started a year before I even graduated as an intern and had a personal connection (at a different agency but that gave me a big edge) I will also go on record and say I have made plenty mistakes learning how to manage myself and my finances as an adult. Still learning! My parents were born in 60 and 64. Which Google told me that they are boomers. I apologize if that\\u2019s not true. Yes, my dad was close to 40 when I was born. No, I did not move out of my parents house as a teenager. And no, staying at their house was not really a good option. Without getting into too many details, there\\u2019s a lot going on there.

And yes, you should even be able to afford a cat. Some of you guys are doing backbends to justify that you think people doing certain jobs don\\u2019t deserve to afford housing or to do anything remotely enjoyable and the fuck is the matter with you? Everyone deserves housing and a living wage idc idc idc. oh and and that applies to young people too since I see a lot of people suggesting you people should be working nonstop but deserve to still be struggling?

It's not, all I'm seeing is more companies refusing to hire anyone and blame us.\\n\\nNo market adjustments happening. Strange.\\n\\nEdit: So this blew up and it's Christmas so I've been spending time with my family and not commenting on reddit. PRIORITIES and that.\\n\\nEveryone's feeling great about themselves atm because everyone's sticking it to their bosses and moving jobs and wages appear to be increasing etc etc, some people's bosses are hearing about it and stepping up, some bosses aren't all that bad anyway. I get all that. That's not the point of this post. I did not need the mechanics of the labour market explaining to me. I understand the mechanics.\\n\\nThis post is about your **lived experience** and your **quality of life**. So yeah, everyone's figuring out that you can get better pay and conditions by quitting your jobs and saying no to unreasonable expectations, go find another job. But then what if the next job is the same? I've just read a post on this sub about someone who had left an extremely toxic job where they were overworked and underappreciated, to move into another job where they were paid significantly better, had autonomy over their time and had time to spend with their friends and family. This was AFTER this particular individual had made the choice to reassess their priorities in life. [Here](https://old.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rn52k6/twas_the_night_before_my_resignation/) is the post in question.\\n\\nThey moved jobs, found better pay and conditions. And then a difficult client came along and the company had a decision to make:\\n\\n- Tell the client they've taken too much time delivering what is necessary and the job cannot be done in time\\n\\n- Pressure the worker to give up their family time over Christmas to get the job done, and not miss out on the fee and the profit, ON TOP OF what the company is making from other clients, and profit that the person *giving up their time to do the work* will likely not see in any meaningful way.\\n\\nThe decision was clear. The decision makers don't want to consider you. That's the whole point.\\n\\nAnd it's not JUST about jobs and work. How are you paying the rent while you're holding firm and refusing to take jobs with underwhelming pay and appalling conditions? Do you need anything done in the home you rent? Is it a great place to live? Is it decorated properly so it can be cleaned? Is it secure? Is it warm? Does it have enough space? You may be unhappy with your home to. So is this the same solution? Just move house if you're not happy? You're paid more now after all... just go find a better home... unless rents start going up to match wage increases. Because they will. As soon as your landlord gets wise, they'll try to jack the rents up. And then rents across the board go up because that's how it works, house prices go up and you end up... back where you started.\\n\\nIs this practical? Is it good for your quality of life to be expected to move home and job all the time just to get what you NEED? This only works until you're not happy with something. Then what? The boss doesn't HAVE to change anything, so it's... moving jobs again. Same with landlords. Find a decent home, eventually find something you're not happy with and asked it to be fixed - what happens when they say no?\\n\\nA better question is... if this is the answer why wasn't everyone doing it already? Just move jobs, move home... the market will correct! Will it? That's not my lived experience and I'm closer to 40 than 20.\\n\\nThe bottom line is... the boss owns your workplace and your landlord owns your home. You cannot make another person do anything they don't want to, so whileever they have the LEGAL POWER to make the decisions with no input from you, they will continue to do so. \\n\\nWhy not apply this to a larger scale? The world's material resources are privately owned or otherwise owned by states, but more importantly - not by you. You have no say in what happens to those material resources unless you can get the money to BUY some. You can't tell people who own oil reserves they're not allowed to sell their oil reserves! And you can't tell people who own all kinds of businesses that rely on oil that they can't buy and use oil with THEIR money! You can't even tell your boss who made money off your work that they're not allowed to drive around all over the place in a 6 litre turbo sports car that gets about 5MPG because they enjoy driving.\\n\\nAnd when they burn the planet down... then what? Just find a new planet? Hold them accountable by making them compete with other planets for workers.\\n\\nIt seems under capitalism, the only way to make them consider YOUR interests while making THEIR decisions about THEIR businesses and THEIR houses and THEIR resources, is to make your own life and their lives considerably more difficult. And we'll all just keep doing this forever and ever and ever shall we?\\n\\nThe solution is to make sure your boss doesn't own your workplace and your landlord doesn't own your home and a tiny set of entitled dickheads don't own the entirety of the world's material resources.\\n\\nShout out for all the awards and all the people who got it in the comments.

Atkins 3d For those who are uninformed: We aren't trying to NOT pay our students loans. The real issue is we don't want to pay on a loan that CANNOT BE PAID OFF because the interest makes it impossible. There are folks who have paid OFF their principal loan amount and somehow their remaining, total loan balance owed is STILL more money than they ever originally borrowed. My loans have $500 in interest accruing evey month. FIVE HUNDRED EXTRA, NEW DOLLARS. EVERY MONTH. So, my student loan balance doesn't decrease. Never. EVER. It is a mathematical certainty that the total loan balance owed will increase every single month. So, for those of you who don't have them or have paid yours off - please know this issue is not about shirking responsibility.

I still have a lot to think about in regards to how I will move forward, but I feel a lot more equipped now thanks to you all. I really appreciate the thoughtful comments!\\n\\nHi everyone. Please let me know if I should post this anywhere else.\\n\\nI have a master\\u2019s degree in Library Science that I obtained in May. I\\u2019ve been looking for a librarian position since then. I still haven\\u2019t found anything though I\\u2019ve applied to many. I thought I would take a library associate job in the meantime (it\\u2019s a paraprofessional role and doesn\\u2019t require any degree).\\n\\nInitially, the manager told me it would pay $10/hr which is obviously horrific. I still went through with the interview and was offered the job verbally. I accepted though I wasn\\u2019t certain if I would go through with it. However, once I received my offer letter it stated I would be paid $20/hr. It\\u2019s still low for a librarian but I thought it was a huge step up and I signed the document that I would accept this rate and take the job. I figured they took my degree into account and decided to pay me more appropriately.\\n\\nYesterday, I received my first paycheck. It was half of what it was supposed to be. I asked the woman who hired me what\\u2019s up and she stated, no, I WAS supposed to be paid that amount. I\\u2019m working for $10/hr. I asked her how that was possible when I signed a document from HR stating I would be paid $20/hr. Since then I spoke with her and HR, who both firmly deny I will be paid that amount, and insist it was a typo/error on their part.\\n\\nI don\\u2019t really know what to do at this point. They REALLY messed up and I know they\\u2019re aware of the fact - the HR woman said we can take this a step higher up and HER boss involved. I have no idea what to expect, except probably a lot of empty apologies and \\u201ccorrective action will be taken\\u201d.\\n\\nThe easiest course would be to simply quit. I don\\u2019t have a backup job though, and as garbage as the pay is, it\\u2019s better than nothing. I need the experience in a library and I get full time hours here.\\n\\nWhat would you all do?

The reality is much higher.\\n- Roughly 1 in 5 Americans are considered to have \\u201cunemployed\\u201d status, or no longer looking for work.\\n- The average studio apartment in the US runs $1,690/ month for rent, yet the median wage in the US is $2800/month before taxes. \\n- The average Student Loan debt is $30,000\\n- The average cost for health insurance (not including copays or deductibles) is $8000/year in the US.\\n- The planet is likely to reach a 1.5C temperature increase within the next 5 years, the limit set in order to prevent permanent changes that threaten the wellbeing of all life.\\n\\nI know everyone agrees with the general sentiment, but this is completely unsustainable.

Today, \\\"the fucking evil business owners\\\" keep it all for themselves\\n- the US education system is designed to condition us to the bullshit work expectations that exist today (he says this started in 1963)\\n- the US education system is inherently and intentionally racist\\n\\nI love my Dad.\\n\\n\\nEdits/updates:\\n\\n1) my Dad is so grateful for all your kind words and all the hugs. He got all bashful when I started reading your responses to him. He's a wine drinker, so rest assured I'll be picking up a few bottles of wine for him on behalf of the r/antiwork community. \\n\\n2) I use the term \\\"Boomer\\\" to describe the Baby Boomer generation, which is what I was taught to call them growing up. My Dad refers to his generation as \\\"Boomers\\\" as well. This is not necessarily a derogatory term. \\n\\n3) the 1963 thing - this is kind of complex, so I'll do my best to reiterate what he said. In 1957, the Soviets launched Sputnik and the US lost its shit. All the sudden every American, politicians included, was convinced the Soviets had surpassed us in science and technology. The response was a swift and sizable Congressional budget increase for education. This effort had two parts - the first to build a bunch of new schools and the second to standardize curriculum. By the time the schools were built and the new curriculum was set, it was 1963. This standardization of curriculum is where the problems started. Schools had previously been able to set their own curriculum, so depending on which school you went to, your curriculum could be completely different than what your friend was taught. The result was a much wider set of information that was being communicated out across the country, so people would discuss differences in what they had learned in school. You know, they would share and debate. When the standardization took place, the curriculum became narrow and prescribed. It became less about creative thinking and problem solving and more about showing up and memorizing what you were told to memorize. My Dad didn't buy into this as a teacher and would teach what he wanted how he wanted. He was actually chastised by a colleague one time because he gave an essay test asking for his students' perspective on a historical event instead of multiple choice for a history exam because \\\"the kids don't need to be thinking about those things that much.\\\"  Essentially, school became about showing up, putting in your time, doing what you were told, and not asking questions. This, as you might imagine, produced the \\\"perfect\\\" employee, so even though we can see the damage it's had on American education, it's a protected model because it benefits corporate America. So I guess it wasn't really \\\"designed\\\" to benefit employers, but they realized almost instantly that it was great for business and encouraged the model even though it was eroding critical thinking skills in the US.\\n\\n4) to all the Boomers that have replied in solidarity - you guys are the best. We know that there are so many of you who are allies and mentors to us. Your replies are so important in helping us destroy the narrative of the generational divide and shining light on the real source of division, which is shitty, soulless corporations that are relying on decades of brainwashing to make us think that the issue is between generations and not between the corporate overlords and the hard-working people they exploit.\",\"Tweet: NXHLVS\\n@NXHLVS\\nAnyone else stuck in this weird cycle\\nwhere work is so exhausting that your\\nhobbies feel like too much work so you\\ndon't do them then you go back to\\nwork upset that you didn't take time to\\ndo the things you like and rinse and\\nrepeat?\",\"Tweet: Fuck You I Quit\\n@fuckyouiquit\\nJohn Deere could give every single employee a $20/hr\\nraise and still net nearly $3,000,000,000 per year in\\nprofit.

We'd just pulled an all-nighter to get a proposal out the door for a potential client. I went to get a coffee since I'd been in the office all night.  While I was gone, they laid him off because we didn't hit the $12 million target in revenue that had been set by head office.  Management knew they were laying him off and they made him work all night anyway.\\n\\nI left shortly after.\\n\\nEDIT: Wow.  Thank you to everyone who responded.  I am slowly working my way through all of them.  I won't reply to them, but I am reading them all. \\n\\nMany have pointed out that expecting to be treated fairly does not make one \\\"radicalized\\\" and I appreciate the sentiment. However, I would counter that anytime you are against the status quo you are a radical. Keep fighting the good fight.  Support your fellow workers and demand your worth!\",\"So a few months ago, I had to inform my boss that I'd be going to my endocrinologist for the three-month check up thing I do in order to have a larger insulin prescription. (I'm a type 1 diabetic on a pump)   \\nShe kinda denies the \\\"PTO request\\\" (As she put it)   \\nI tell her, no. I can't miss this. I have a documented disability and have to go to this appointment. This isn't me requesting a PTO day. This is me telling her I'm going to miss a day in three months.    \\nShe's not too happy about that and goes to HR. HR tells her it's a documented disability. She then claims that I don't have an accommodation form submitted for extra days off. This has went on until last month. HR gives me paper work so I could have accommodations. My doctor (God bless her) had a bit of a field day upon learning what my boss had done.    \\nWhat would have been a single day off to go to an appointment I had informed my boss of three months in advance has now turned into:    \\n\\n\\n1. Must get a day off anytime there is a scheduled medical appointment \\n2. Must be allowed extra meal and rest breaks depending on BG levels. \\n3. If BG is ever <50 or >300, must be allowed to take a sick day\\n4. Must be allowed to have cell phone at all times (Some sites have a policy that says you can't have it at your desk even if you're work-from-home like me) \\n5. Must be allowed breaks as needed for pump, infusion site, and CGM maintenance. (Basically, if a sensor for my glucose ever fails on me in the middle of something, I can just throw my hands up and say I have to go fix it right then and there.)  \\n\\nAs these are doctor recommended, and I submitted them on an ADA form, my boss can't fight it.\",\"??????????????????????\\n\\nEdit: going to get tested now, thanks everyone for the support. I need insurance cause I need my psychiatric meds, but y'all are right, I really shouldn't go in. Hopefully I get the results back before 6pm and don't have to burn bridges, but otherwise, any advice as to what I should tell her and how to not give in at the first sign of adversity would be appreciated. Thanks again for all the support.\\n\\nEdit 2: it took four hours, but I finally got tested. Won't get results till Saturday, so I told my boss that I don't feel comfortable endangering the residents and my coworkers, and now I'm going tf to sleep. If they have a problem with that, I won't find out till after it matters. (also I already had it writing when I posted this, she texted me)\\n\\nLast edit: looks like my shifts will be covered indefinitely while I recover. Thanks again to everyone who supported me/helped me come up with what to say. \\n\\nI'm sure I'm not the only one in this sub who has trouble with conflict and a deep, unreasonable sense of responsibility to their employers. Y'all can do a lot of good for them like you did for me, keep it up.\\n\\nOk, for real last edit: For anyone who is still invested, the test came back positive, and I intend on spending my quarantine looking for new work.\",\"I was shocked, needless to say. He was so excited when he got the job right out of college and my wife and I rejoiced with him. Over the course of the next couple of years, however, I saw the joy -- not just about the job, but about life in general -- drain away. Over Thanksgiving, he talked about insane deadlines, a boss who micromanaged, and a business owner who ruled with an iron fist. I encouraged him, but could tell he wasn't the happy-go-lucky son I once had.\\n\\nSo this past weekend, when he told us over the phone (he lives in a neighboring state) he walked off the job after a heated argument with his boss, he started sobbing and apologizing. I said, \\\"Son, you have nothing to apologize for. No job is worth what I see this job doing to you.\\\" His \\\"shame\\\" was compounded by being married for only a couple of years and having a two-year-old daughter. He then asked if they could stay with us for a couple of months until he figures things out. I told him not to worry. We've got a big house and everyone is welcome.\\n\\nMore apologies. Promises he'd get a job as soon as he could. My wife and I told him not to worry about it. In fact, we said a condition of him returning would be that he NOT find work until he's taken care of himself. He struggles with depression anyway, so I said he should see a psych/therapist, get the help he needs to recover his mental wellness, and go from there. No timelines. No promises needed. He was beyond grateful. No parent wants to see their child struggle because of their job.\\n\\nSo this is a shout-out to all parents of children regardless of age: We can be a part of the antiwork/labor movement. We can be a \\\"safe haven\\\" from abusive work relationships. We can TRUST our kids to make the right choices and encourage them to do whatever they think they need to to have a fulfilling happy life. The only thing any good parent ever wants from their children is that they have the best of all life has to offer.\\n\\n\\\\*EDIT\\\\* - To the many kind commenters who praise me for being a great parent, I have to say we made a ton of mistakes with our kids. I've been known to be a real asshole sometimes. Nevertheless, my wife and I always showed our kids we love each other and can get through anything so long as we go through it together.\\n\\n\\\\*EDIT 2\\\\* DANG. Thanks for all the updoots! I left to get groceries and when I got back this thing apparently blew up. While I was out, the thought occurred to me that r/antiwork is really about fundamental cultural change. Parents are wack? Find someone in your life who gets you and wants to help you get where you want to go. Friends can be as powerful an influence as family. Either way, we should consider it our patriotic duty to help others walk away from abusive employers and demand better. \",\"I\\u2019m leaving my second job after a year of draining work with a controlling boss who doesn\\u2019t actually understand anything administrative. It\\u2019s a small private mental health practice and I was the only one in the office from March to September. I\\u2019m burnt out. \\n\\nI taught myself 95% of that job and put so many systems in place that I created, which they desperately needed in case of an audit. When we hired a new person in September, my boss told me we were going to be paid the same and freaked out at me for any time we both spent on the clock as I trained her. Pretty soon, I was answering a million questions off the clock. \\n\\nLast week, I told her I plan to leave but didn\\u2019t give a specific time frame as she is a genuinely good therapist and I didn\\u2019t want to leave the practice in a lurch by being abrupt. She texted me on Saturday and told me I was training my replacement on Wednesday. \\n\\nTwo minutes before the replacement got there, she informed me she was giving a raise to the other girl and starting the new girl at a few dollars an hour more than I make ($16). When the girl got there, my boss told her that I\\u2019m too anxious for the job and implied I\\u2019m not capable of being a therapist (my goal - I start grad school this year).\\n\\nI told my boss I\\u2019d be available for three weeks from my last day to answer questions by text as I\\u2019m still the only one who knows a lot of things, but that I\\u2019d no longer be available after that. She just looks me in the eye and shrugged and says \\u201cI mean I\\u2019ll always be able to ask you.\\u201d And I just froze. \\n\\nI\\u2019m so angry and hurt. I feel that I\\u2019ve been taken advantage of for the last year and that she\\u2019s still trying to.\\n\\nEdit: I know I\\u2019ve messed up in trying to keep the relationship and what I\\u2019ve let her get away with. Hopefully I can be strong and firm as I leave and chalk this up to a learning experience.\\n\\nEdit 2: Wow the response has been huge. You guys definitely woke me up. I just sent out a practice wide email, letting everyone know my last day is Wednesday and they need to ask me any questions they have before then. I laid out some expectations, not quite as firm as some of you suggested but it\\u2019s a huge step in advocating for myself which I\\u2019ve always struggled with. Thanks for the feedback!\\n\\nEdit 3: I just posted this in a comment but for those asking why I think she\\u2019s a good therapist I said \\u201cI\\u2019m trying to read through the 2k+ comments now and I\\u2019ll address that! I base it on two things: the way her clients talk about her and the way she acts/talks in what we call staffing sessions, which is basically where the therapists put their head together when they get stuck with a client. It\\u2019s literally like she becomes a different person with all this patience, knowledge, and insight. I\\u2019ve described her snapping into therapist mode to a lot of people over the last year. \\u201c I think people sometimes choose what parts of you they show you. I bet a lot of her clients wouldn\\u2019t want to see her if they saw how she is to me, but they don\\u2019t.\",\"A few weeks ago I started looking for a new job. I attended an interview and was told on the spot that the job was mine. I received the contract a few days later, signed and sent it back. Since then I\\u2019ve kept everything to myself and not told anyone but family & my partner.\\n\\nI like my current job, but I don\\u2019t like the chain of command. I\\u2019m a goods in team leader and stock controller who reports to both a supervisor and a manager. Neither of those have any involvement in the day to day running of the department. I\\u2019m the only one who knows how certain things are done on the system, I get no help from them. Ive had to teach myself everything I know over the past 5 years. I often get told somethings not my job and they\\u2019re right, it\\u2019s theirs but they don\\u2019t do it. Any improvements I try to make are ignored or \\u201cspoken about and decided against\\u201d.\\n\\nLast night when everyone had left, I typed up my two week notice and slid it under the door for for HR dept. My last official day is January 3rd. The company don\\u2019t come back from Christmas break until January 4th. They have no time to replace me. I\\u2019m on holiday today but I\\u2019m in tomorrow. My personal phone has been blowing up today from my manager and supervisor. All calls have been ignored.\\n\\nTomorrow should be fun!\\n\\n\\nUPDATE (Also made as a separate post):\\n\\nMy work hours are 6-2, another guy works 2-10 so we overlap during busy delivery slots. However both S & M work 9-5. I arrive at my usual time & catch up on what I\\u2019ve been left from the previous shift the day before. All is quiet until S & M both arrive together joined at the hip bang on 9am. \\n\\nThey request a meeting at 10am, but I politely decline as that\\u2019s when I have my 30 minute break. They request a meeting at 10:30am, and again I decline unless HR and/or upper management are there. \\n\\n9:15am I get a phone call from the MDs secretary requesting i go up to his office immediately. I arrive up there to him and the financial director (he oversees the whole of the stock process as a whole). They ask me why it\\u2019s come to this & I calmly explain what I mentioned in the first post and point them to previous times I\\u2019ve told them what I thought of the chain of command. They say that they thought I was just kidding. I say no. On the spot they offer to change the chain of command and give me full control. I politely decline on the basis that they wouldn\\u2019t do that if I wasn\\u2019t right in everything I\\u2019ve said. If they knew that then they should have done something about it without me needing to hand in my notice. I\\u2019m then told to come back up at 12pm.\\n\\nI continue with work like a professional, doing my usual day to day tasks & helping out the late shift guy with his paperwork from the previous day. All this time I\\u2019m getting daggers from S & M, I just smile & wave.\\n\\nAt 12:05pm (make them sweat) I go upstairs to the MD & the project director sitting down together. I\\u2019m I go. They offer me a completely different role including the purchase of stock, hiring of equipment, cost analysis & a bit of sales. I politely decline as my new job is sales with better benefits. They take an interest in my new job & start asking about the package I\\u2019m leaving for. I have no issue discussing it so I tell them about the basic, company car, commission & health benefits. They seem quite impressed at what I\\u2019ve been offered (I was when I received the offer). We talk a bit more about everything and they seem to listen to what I say quite keenly, at the end there are handshakes, goodbyes & well wishes. All in all I\\u2019m with them until about 13:15pm & at this point I\\u2019ve still not had my 30 minute break, so I do just that. \\n\\nI go back in at 13:40pm as I need to get my personal stuff together ready to go. I have a chat with the late shift guy who\\u2019s laughing at everything I\\u2019m telling him about the above. We shake hands & promise to have a beer in the new year. He\\u2019s someone I\\u2019d class as a close friend.\\n\\nAt 13:55pm both S & M walk in and demand to know how some of the system works as they\\u2019ll have to cover for me until a replacement is found. Unfortunately I\\u2019ve just logged out and shut down the computer, and it takes 5 minutes to load everything up before it can be used. No can do babydoll. I pick up my personal stuff, smile & wink, say goodbye & saunter out to my car.\\n\\nMy late shift buddy said he\\u2019ll ring me when he finishes to let me know what was said after I left & if there was any blowback for those two.\\n\\nIf you made it to here, thanks for reading!\",\"First time ever being fired, let alone even talked to negatively by an employer...I don't know how to react.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nStill in the probation period,\\n\\n\\\\- one warehouse manager yelled at me on the phone and told me \\\"Do you know who I am?!\\\" all I said was \\\"please be respectful\\\" and she wrote me up to HR\\n\\n\\\\- Site supervisor made me wait in -30C weather with a delivery at the gate for 2.5 hours all I said when HE called me was \\\"please try to hurry I have other deliveries due today\\\" and he proceeded to call me a bitch on the company phone, then wrote me up to HR - HE got reprimanded with a day off unpaid\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\- Third write up was for \\\"discussing pay with other employees\\\"\\n\\nThey told me \\\"Merry Christmas\\\" as they walked me to my car like a criminal...I'm in shock\",\"I'm a waiter and get paid 2 dollars an hour plus tip.

Eventually the machine broke and they contacted me to fix it but I refused. Company lost clients and sunk.\\n\\nSo this was 2 years ago, and I'm not American.\\nI worked at a factory as a mechanic and operator of a very high-end machine.\\n\\nOnee time this machine broke and no one, including me, could fix it and they had to bring an engineer from abroad to fix it. This engineer only spoke English, and I was the only English speaker of the company, so I was of course the person to help him and at the same time learn everything I could about how this machine worked.\\n\\nThis guy was SO nice and basically was teaching me everything he could while disassembling and assembling the thing, and I learnt a lot about it. On his last days we had to work for 35 hours straight because his flight was due and there was just so much to do. If he didn't finish, he would get in trouble, and I probably wouldn't have a job either.\\n\\nBefore he left, he told me that there was a part that needed to be replaced when it broke, taught me how to change it, and promised to mail it to me when he was back at his country - and he did, to my house, not the company.\\n\\nMy manager and the owner were so happy about it, they were very grateful (although not very much money wise), and I felt so secure because now I was the only person in the country that knew how to fix this machine that was vital to the company.\\n\\nSo fast forward a year, the pandemic broke out and I wanted to stay at home. The owner and manager pressured me into going anyway. They found a loophole and bribed some officials into giving us all \\\"essential worker status\\\" so we could go legally. I thought long about this, and thinking that I would be unemployed if I didn't go, or maybe dead if I went, at the end I got influenced by the wife and went to work. \\n\\nI went to work a Monday, and on Friday I had a fever. Got tested, was positive.\\n\\nHaving COVID has been easily one of the worst experiences I've had, and I wasn't very far from dying.\\nWeeks later, after I was finally well enough to work, I returned and was fired on the spot. They didn't even let me go inside to get my stuff. They had already hired someone to operate my machine.\\n\\nThings were really tough being unemployed and now also weak, and somehow we got by. About 6 months later I got a text from them saying that the machine had a failure and they needed me to come in and fix it. They offered a rather high sum, over a month's of my former salary. A coworker phoned me and told me that they were desperate, and to ask 4 times that amount, they would pay it easily.\\n\\nI didn't know what to do. I had the piece they needed and the knowledge to replace it. They tried to get the engineer again but flights were cancelled. They tried following instructions but they couldn't communicate. And they were missing a piece they didn't even know they needed. I had them by the balls.\\n\\nI spoke to my friends and family about it and they pressured me to bleed them and enjoy the free money, but after thinking about it I decided to not help them. The money would have been nice, but something told me they didn't care about money, they did what they wanted and threw money at problems to solve them. But I knew I could be the one to get them out of their damned privilege bubble and I did.\\n\\nThey are now selling all the equipment, machines, and stock. Without the machine they couldn't be competitive and went broke.\\n\\nToday I have mixed feelings about it because old coworkers are now unemployed.\\n\\nEdit: \\n\\nFirst, I'd like to use all of this wild visibility to remind you all to get up, stretch and drink a glass of water. \\n\\nNow, I'll try to answer some of the common questions since I tried to do it comment by comment but there's just a lot of them.\\n\\n1) What machine is it. I didn't want to say it for privacy, but since there are so many curious people, it is a 20000 watt Yag laser cutter. The piece is a part of the laser generator circuit board, and you have to unmount it completely to change it, and also it must be soldered. It's so easy to damage it and so expensive that no one with 2 neurons would touch it if they don't know exactly what they are doing, and the rest you don't want them near it. Also, the knowledge needed to figure that it's that one piece over the rest is just too specific.\\n\\n\\n2) Why didn't I sue them. I got paid 3 months of salary for being fired. I knew I could challenge my dismissal, but these procedures usually take months, even a year. And with COVID, this was practically frozen. I needed the money. Being poor sucks.\\n\\n\\n3) I didn't know the company would be hit so hard, I just wanted to make a bit of justice. I never intended for anyone to be unemployed and had I known what happened I would have fixed the damn thing.\\n\\n\\n4) The piece was mailed to me by the engineer. We became friends during his stay because his card failed at the ATMs and I gave him local cash for crypto. He was grateful and sent it to ME as a gift, so I could be a 'hero' to the company in the future. The piece costs about 25USD, but it is very specific to the model. \\n\\n\\n5) Many say the story is fake and that's fine. I always encourage others not to believe everything they read. I don't expect special treatment with this. I commend you for it.\\n\\nEdit 2: added a TL;DR at the beginning because u/Canna_Chris_ asked.\",\"I was in a local grocery store recently and only 2 registers were open in a slammed store.  When the line moved up to this woman, she put her things up to be rung up and asked the cashier to speak to the store manager.  The cashier goes and flags down someone who then goes and gets the store manager.  This woman goes full on Karen about how there should be at least 6 to 7 registers open and this was completely unacceptable.\\n\\nFunny how to a lot of people, these jobs aren't \\\"real jobs\\\" that deserve \\\"real pay\\\" until someone is inconvenienced by these jobs. I notice the same thing with fast food joints. Saw a woman flip the fuck out at a drive thru at popeyes about how slow the line was going.  The woman at the window apologized and said they were short staffed and were doing the best they can. \\n\\nIts all fun and games to people until its them experiencing an inconvenience then it suddenly becomes \\\"A real job\\\" to be concerned about.\",\"Hi Redditors,  just a thank you for empowering me!\\n\\nAs the title suggests, I just got laughed at by one of my company's HR reps.  Backstory: I recently interviewed for an internal transfer position \\\"promotion\\\" to a weekend option position.  My current position rotates through weekend for which I am paid a significant shift differential.  The new job is \\\"salaried\\\" at my \\\"base rate\\\", which would represent a several thousand dollar pay cut.\\n\\nI told the woman that the offer was unacceptable because, not only did it represent a pay cut, it also represented a significant loss in earnings potential.   This was the first time she laughed at me.  I refused to be bullied because of the posts I've read on this subreddit.  I asked her to go back to the managers and tell them my counter and she laughed again.  \\\"I'll do that if you want, but I already know the answer (laughter continuing)\\\".  At this point, I told her that nothing about this is funny.  This is my career and her offer of a promotion with pay cut and earning potential loss was not funny.  She then had the audacity to say \\\"I'm not laughing at you, I'm just laughing\\\".  I said well nothing about this funny to me.\\n\\nI'm usually very shy about advocating for myself in these positions, but all your stories have really empowered me.  I felt like you were all standing there with me not letting me get bullied.\\n\\nThanks Reddit!\\n\\nFrom a front line Covid nurse\\n\\nFinal Update: **spoke to the upper level hiring manager and she apologized for my experience.

My boss, the business owner asked for my input in how we reward the team - he was thinking a team activity or Xmas bonus.  \\n\\nThis sub has really made me question why we spend so much of our life working just to get by, so I put together a proposal - let\\u2019s work less and give everyone more space in their personal life. \\n\\nMy proposal was:\\n\\n- to provide a permanent pay increase of 10% to all staff. \\n\\n- give an extra 5 days off per year (I come from a country where 4 weeks is standard, so this increased to 5 weeks total).\\n\\n- make Monday an optional work day. Finish all your work from last week? Great, don\\u2019t come in. The week officially begins on Tuesday and that\\u2019s when we meet together. Feeling a little behind? Your Monday is for you to catch up from home, and you don\\u2019t have to meet or work with anyone else. \\n\\nThe proposal was accepted 4 months ago, and all I can say is wowwww - what a difference it\\u2019s made to the team happiness, with no decline in revenue. \\n\\nIt\\u2019s a fairly different story to what is posted here usually, but I wanted to share it, as without this sub I would never have thought to suggest such a thing.\",\"Quick background, I\\u2019ve worked for a Fortune 500 company for 8 years in system/data analyst roles and have a senior title. The company is having hiring struggles and has had ALOT of recent turnover at the corporate level (where I\\u2019m at). I utilize a pretty specialized software platform and the job market for experienced users has been hot. My company made some market pay adjustments but my name didn\\u2019t make the list (though all my bosses did).\\n\\nI managed to land a local government position that has better hours, pension, time off, and A 50% INCREASE. I gave my resignation on Friday and yesterday (Monday) I had no less than 4 different meetings with various company leaders asking (begging? demanding?) for me to change my mind. They all started with the soft approach of \\u201cyou\\u2019re so talented, we really see you growing with this company\\u201d, told me they could maybe open up opportunities, and said something to the effect of \\u201cwe just want to make sure you\\u2019re making the right decision for you and your family\\u201d. \\n\\nFirst off, fuck you. We\\u2019re not friends.\\n\\nI figured this would happen so I had a few talking points prepared. Like how I had repeatedly recommended people on my team be cross trained on the systems I use but no action was taken. Or that I had been micromanaged to death and then blamed when results weren\\u2019t great because of conflicting directions (I have 3 direct bosses y\\u2019all). Or the fact that my salary had been cut during the pandemic, and hadn\\u2019t been restored fully because I didn\\u2019t meet my set goals, when my boss AVOIDED MY GOAL SETTING/REVIEW MEETINGS FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR.\\n\\nBut, like the professional I am, I always left the door open for a counter. Think something along the lines of \\u201cI don\\u2019t think this role has afforded me the opportunity to advance my career. If there\\u2019s another role that you think I would be well suited for I\\u2019m happy to consider it. This new position is a 50% increase so I would be looking for comparable compensation\\u201d\\n\\nAs you can imagine, they all flipped shit. I got responses like \\u201cyour performance doesn\\u2019t justify that kind of increase\\u201d or \\u201cwe don\\u2019t do raises out of cycle\\u201d (we totally do). One VP said I would be too bored in government and should stay where the action is. They offered me lateral job changes, they offered mentorship programs. One tried the tactic that my dedication would pay off eventually if I just stuck with it, but refused to put that commitment in writing. Not a single one offered to match the pay increase.\\n\\nI found out today that my calendar has been stripped of all meetings for the rest of my time here. No training, no transition plan, just do your work and get out. I imagine they don\\u2019t want me poisoning the well and giving other people crazy ideas of what their market value is. So I\\u2019m going to spend the time browsing Reddit, sending messages to my coworkers about their earning potential and enjoying collecting a paycheck with zero effort. \\n\\nKeep up the good fight. Eventually they\\u2019ll figure out that they\\u2019re the problem.\",\"So...\\n\\nMy boss and co-worker have decided to give me a nickname! As the title suggests, they call me \\\"5:01\\\", because I leave almost bang on at the end of my day, which starts at 8:00am and ends on 5:00pm.\\n\\nFor context, at this particular establishment, overtime is *unpaid*. So, for every minute I'm there **after** 5:00pm, my time is unpaid. Well, as my boss would put it, paid in **benefits**, which I have not used nor do I plan to, as they're of no use to me. And he absolutely will not change his stance on that.\\n\\nSo, as a result of that particular policy, I make a point of doing almost no overtime. In dire straits to get a job done? Unfortunately, we're not a non-for-profit organisation, and I'm not donating my time, so it falls under the 'not my problem' policy I've established.\\n\\nAnd as a result of my stoic approach, they've given me a rather ~~demoralising, and frankly, humiliating~~ awesome new nickname, which I'll be taking in my stride.\\n\\nAnd after the last shenanigan of them not being able to pay my wage one week, I'm now looking for alternative employment. Or, maybe nothing at all. I'm not going to take being treated as sub-human just because I refuse to give my time away to make someone else money.\\n\\n*You can call people lazy all you want, but that's just because you've spent your life working, trying to prove to yourself, that you're not, and now you regret it.*\\n\\n__________________________________________\\n\\nHey everyone.\\n\\nThis absolutely exploded far beyond what I had considered it would. Allow me to add some context to the post.\\n\\nWe're Australian. I do believe there is labour laws against not paying overtime. \\nThe benefits I had alluded to, can essentially be summed up as \\\"big discounts on stuff\\\". That's it. While it's inferred that I leave on the dot at 5:01, it's more like 5:10/5:15. Sometimes later. Hence the mild irritation. Call me Mr. 5:10, for Gods sakes. \\nThere's very little downtime on the job, so it's hours of solid work. No, I'm not a clock watcher. \\n\\nI can answer some more tomorrow. You guys are the best.

We became friends *outside of the workplace* in October 2020 and started dating mid-November. We keep things professional at work. Everything was wonderful until we had the unfortunate luck of being seen BY NONE OTHER THAN HIS FUCKING MANAGER in the most incriminating, \\\"not-so-casually-dating\\\" place: a local grocery store. We were on a company-wide winter break during this time.\\n\\nWe returned to work in January 2021 and on literally the first day back, my boyfriend's manager pulls him aside and pressures him to \\\"do the right thing\\\" and declare our relationship to HR. Neither of us thought we'd ever be in a situation where we'd be dating a coworker, but here we were. Time to own up.

I am not even allowed to apply, because the application requires my manager's signature\\n\\nMy boyfriend is great and despite all of this, we're still together. Our shared hatred for this place only serves to make our love stronger.\\n\\n1 upvote and we're both out of here.\\n\\n**EDIT:**\\n\\nWHAT HAPPENED TO THIS POST! How did it blow up? My boyfriend was supposed to be my only upvote!\\n\\nHaha but reading all of your comments has been such a nice change of pace from what we'd usually be doing on a nondescript Wednesday.

I got all my work done on time, even ahead of deadline. As a remote employee I made sure that they were never waiting on me. \\n\\nOne day I get a call from the owner and he tells me:\\n\\n\\u201cHey! I\\u2019m going to be in your state at the capital to pitch a new program out there. Do you think you can meet me at the capital on Monday morning and we can work on the presentation together for later that morning?\\u201d\\n\\nSure. No sweat. He\\u2019s always dropped last minute things like this in my lap so it was par for the course. He got me a room at the hotel he was staying at, and I spent Sunday evening driving up there so I could be ready to bang out this presentation first thing in the morning. \\n\\nSo Monday morning arrives, and I head down to the lobby to get started to work and he\\u2019s already in the lobby waiting for me. And he starts off by greeting me by:\\n\\n\\u201cThis isn\\u2019t going to be easy\\u2026\\u201d\\n\\nRight then and there I knew he was firing me. So I closed my laptop and let him say his piece. Saying that there wasn\\u2019t enough work to keep me employed and that he was sorry. And I flat out told him: \\u201cSo you flew 2700 miles and made me drive 3 hours just so you can fire me?\\u201d And his response was \\u201cYeah, I wanted to make sure I got the laptop back in one piece.\\u201d \\n\\nSo, I handed him the laptop, went upstairs, grabbed my things and drove 3 hours home. \\n\\nOn the way home I had a lot of time to reflect, and make myself more angry. Then I became spiteful after all the times I worked late, and busted out projects for the company that would sometimes force me to work late. Then I remembered\\u2026\\n\\nAll my art files are saved exclusively on my personal iCloud Drive. What files aren\\u2019t currently loaded into the laptop would go away if I revoke access to that laptop from my iTunes account. So that\\u2019s what I did. \\n\\nI get a call a week later from their new artist (not enough work huh?) saying their having trouble accessing the art files on the computer, and I never returned his call. \\n\\nIn retrospect, it was a pretty shitty thing for me to do, but if he wouldn\\u2019t have wasted my time I would have shipped the laptop back because I\\u2019m not a complete asshole.

I immediately know we're talking compensation.\\n\\nHR joins the meeting, and tells me that I was selected to receive a retention bonus of 20k. Holy shit, that's a ton of cash, I'm listening. HR continues to tell me that I have to *sign an agreement* to receive the bonus. **RED FLAG**\\n\\nHR sends over the agreement and I take a look. Its not a 20k bonus, its a 20k installment plan. Payable in 5k payments every other quarter until 2023 - after taxes for me, that will be around 2.2k each. The catch is, if I leave **for any reason** I need to pay back the bonus in full. I work in an at-will state, I can be fired for any reason to begin with. Now they'll have 20k worth of leverage on me. **RED FLAG**\\n\\nPaperwork continues to state that if my performance drops - at my employer's sole discretion - I must pay back the bonus. **RED FLAG**\\n\\nLast little bit in the agreement was a line that states that I 'felt the 20k was fair compensation for fulfilling the obligations of the agreement'. They want me to sign away my rights to discuss this bonus/agreement and other compensation, along with putting yet another collar around my neck for 2 years, for 20k. Not even 20k - 10k extra each year. In this labor market.\\n\\nI ain't signing shit.\\n\\nI've been with this company for 2.5 years.

Fuck them.\",\"Years ago, I worked for a small (30 employee) emergency telecommunications company in Western Michigan for $80,000/yr. This company hired me to help make a new embedded Linux product with an IP camera. For a year or so, all was going well until a co-worker's dad had a stroke, and he had to resign during the middle of the project. The co-worker also happens to be my longest-lasting friend.\\n\\nUpper management's first reaction when they heard about my friend's dad's stroke wasn't, \\\"Is his dad OK?\\\" It was: \\\"Can you finish the project without him?\\\"\\n\\nMistake 1: I should have quit right then and there, but I was young and naive. Instead of quitting, I asked for a $40,000 raise to cover the added responsibility of being the sole engineer on an entire project that could have made the company millions.\\n\\nMistake 2: The CEO (David) told me he would give me the raise once the product was released. (I did not get this in writing. Good god, I was dumb.)\\n\\nMistake 3: I continued to work longer and longer hours. For over six months, I worked 80+ hours a week. I was there at 04:30, and I left at or later than 20:00. My marriage suffered, and I became a zombie and depressed, but I was naive enough to try and \\\"climb the corporate ladder.\\\"\\n\\nI had enough at the 6\\\\~ month mark, and I went to the CEO and demanded my raise right then and there. He looked at me and said, \\\"what raise? I never promised you a raise. We are trying to cut costs to increase their EBITDA! I could replace you in 2 weeks.\\\" (I'm not too fond of the very sound of that acronym now.)\\n\\nI immediately started to look for new jobs and found one within three days that was fully remote and paid $120,000 a year. I put in my two-week notice, and in my resignation email, I specifically stated that this is more than enough time as David said he could replace me in 2 weeks. The panic that ensued was fantastic. Immediately they had to hire a 3rd party engineering company to finish the project, which ran around $500,000. After that, it took them over a year to find a replacement for me, and he left within a year. I later messaged him on LinkedIn, and he said the company had gone to shit, and they continually blamed me for the failure of the product. The company hasn't made a single post on social media in almost a year, and they haven't pushed any updates to any of their products in about the same amount of time.\\n\\n\\nBonus things about my insane time at the company:\\n\\n- The CEO looked at me once and said, \\\"The owner understands sacrifice. He had to sell his summer home.\\\"\\n\\n - The CEO also went from a fairly reasonable guy to a straight-up lumberjack looking crazy born-again ranting mad-man with a huge beard.\\n\\n\\nKnow your worth, and quit early. Raises are a scam, and companies would much rather cut off their nose to spite their face. If you are doing extra work you will be noticed, but not for a promotion. You taught the employer that you will do extra work for nothing. No job is worth your health or your family. \\n\\nFriends dad edit: He lived. The tough-as-nails bastard spent three days on the floor before a neighbor found him on the brink of death.

To those questioning the validity of my story because I\\u2019m saying the hours at the hospital are less intense, I\\u2019m going from working 13 or 14 hour days(starts at 4am sometimes earlier til around 5pm or 6pm from the lack of clerks) 6 days a week at the bakery to 5 days a week with rotating weekends off at the hospital. \\n\\nI guess a little update is that at the end up my shift last night my manager talked to me to see if I could stay until thanksgiving because she has PTO and going out of town that week and if I left she would have to work.

I absolutely love doing it and have learned so much by having the freedom to run the shop as I please. That is, until my boss gets in the way. He is a classic, 7-days-a-week workaholic who has never taken a vacation. While I was impressed by his work ethic at first, it became apparent that this man is working himself into the grave. The guy certainly knows how to work hard, but not smart. Inefficient, unorganized, and forgetful are the top descriptors I would use for how he ran his business. While it was frustrating that he could never invoice any customer on time, it became worse once he began giving me excuses as to why I was being paid a measly $17.50 after I had long completed my apprenticeship. He hired me right out of high school and it is clear to me now that I was being taken advantage of due to my passion and love for the sport of sailing. He gave me all the time-off I wanted, but couldn\\u2019t pay a decent wage. (P.S. this is exactly how NOT to motivate your staff)\\n\\nI don\\u2019t live on a coast, so sail-making is a very rare trade in my area. (I\\u2019m the only one in my entire state) After year 3, I felt like a big fish in a small pond who was being paid bread crumbs to do a highly skilled craft that I was very passionate about. So naturally I started looking around for other options. Well, last week I ended up landing a position as a super-yacht sailmaker in Auckland, NZL (the sailing capital of the Southern Hemisphere, if not the world!) I accepted without even blinking and now plan on staying with a friend in Hawaii after Christmas to await the border re-opening. I decided to give my boss advanced notice on this because I\\u2019m an absolute angel of an employee. But mostly because I couldn\\u2019t wait to see the look on his face when I told him about my new gig. Well, I told him on Friday afternoon and the first thing out of his mouth was, \\u201cI was about to give you a raise, but I guess not anymore!\\u201d \\n\\nHad I listened to my naughty side, there would have been a stapler between his eyeballs at this point. However, I played it cool and responded with, \\u201cNow you can put those extra pennies in your piggy bank!\\u201d And walked out the door. I\\u2019m pretty sure I just made my remaining time there awkward as hell and my boss saltier than the Pacific Ocean, but damn, I don\\u2019t care! I legitimately cried tears of joy on the way home and I have so much to look forward to in this upcoming adventure. A few months ago, I thought I was going to be stuck running his shitty business after he croaked from a heart attack. But now I\\u2019m free! I get to go work in a country that understands how to properly regulate wages and doesn\\u2019t dangle healthcare in front of you like a carrot on a stick. Goodbye, Uncle Sam! See you in hell!\",\"I'm back! Interviewing with a few companies lately, and this has been one of the worst experiences.\\n\\nStore opens at 10, interview is at 10. Walk up at 9:55, door is locked. Sit on the bench by the door. They didn't unlock the doors by 10:02 so I stood in front of the door and saw an employee counting the drawer. She came and unlocked the door at 10:05. Said the manager will be here in 5 minutes.\\n\\nManager comes in at 10:10. We go into the office, she starts by saying \\\"I don't know if I want to interview someone who's late.\\\" ?? I tell her I got there 5 minutes early, and her employee is the one who didn't open the door until 5 minutes after opening time. Then reminded her that she was 10 minutes late, and asked what does that say about her? We did a short interview.\\n\\nI called corporate the second I left.\\n\\nUpdate: I just got off the phone with the regional manager of this company, and she took this very seriously!! Asked me all of the details and even took the time to ask about myself and see how I was doing and wished me luck finding a position!! Best outcome I could have hoped for!\",\"So I told her no I don't and she insisted by law that I do. So I told her no I don't and she can ask all she wants to but that's not going to change it. I said if it's company policy that they'll just have to discipline me for it. She dropped it afterwards.\",\"So this year I went above and beyond.  I mean ABOVE AND BEYOND.  We were extremely behind on product shipments and I had a training course that required like 7 tests to complete.  I studied on my own time at home and instead of me taking the full week long course, I tested out in 6 hours.  I then spent the rest of the week building products to ensure we could ship.  My boss gave me a pat on the back, and said \\\"We are going to have something special for you on your year end review!\\\"\\n\\nYear end review comes.  I receive a plaque with my name on it, and they talk about me in the company meeting.  \\n\\nI went above and beyond!

I immediately recognized that I'm being targeted by the karens to get rid of me because it's important that I play their childish games.\\n\\nSo I hold my ground and explain that I can't fix behavior if I'm not told what it was that i was doing wrong. They explained that I was being lewd/rude on a personal cellphone call. As you can tell I do cuss a lot never in office, and I'm never on a personal call unless I'm on a break, or on lunch (unpaid 1hr) so I asked for further details, when, where, what did I say etc.\\n\\nWhat it was: Yesterday, while I was on my lunch break, I was outside in a little patio area where lots of people eat their lunches outside.

If you feel If i'm just bitter due to my dismissal please call me out on it as I need a wake up call.\\n\\nOver the fall semester I was a police recruit at a Community Colleges Police Academy in a midwestern liberal city. I have always wanted to be a police officer, and I felt like I could help kickstart a change of new wave cops. I am passionate about community oriented policing, making connections with the youth in policing, and changing lives on a individual level. I knew police academy would be mentally and physically challenging, but boy oh boy does policing need to change.\\n\\nInstructors taught us to view citizens as enemy combatants, and told us we needed a warrior mindest and that we were going into battle everyday. It felt like i was joining a cult. Instructors told us supporting our fellow police officers were more important than serving citizens. Instructors told us that we were joining a big bad gang of police officers and that protecting the thin blue line was sacred. Instructors told us George Floyd wasn't a problem and was just one bad officer. I tried to push back on some of these ideas and posed to an instructor that 4 other officers watched chauvin pin floyd to the ground and did nothing, and perhaps they did nothing because they were trained in academy to never speak agaisnt a senior officer. I was told to \\\"shut my fucking face, and that i had no idea what i was talking about.\\n\\nSadly, Instructors on several occasions, and most shockingly in the first week asked every person who supported Black Lives Matter to raise their hands. I and about a third of the class did. They told us that we should seriously consider not being police officers if we supported anti cop organizations. They told us BLM was a terrible organization and to get out if we supported them. Instructors repeatedly made anti lgbt comments and transphobic comments.\\n\\nAdmittedly I was the most progressive and put a target on my back for challenging instructor viewpoints. This got me disciplined, yelled at, and made me not want to be a cop. We had very little training on de-escalation and community policing. We had no diversity or ethics training.\\n\\nDespite all this I made it to the final day. I thought if I could just get through this I could get hired and make a difference in the community as a cop and not be subject to academy paramilitary crap. The police academy dismissed me on the final day because I failed a PT test that I had passed multiple times easily in the academy leading up to this day. I asked why I failed and they said my push up form was bad and they were being more strict know it was the final. I responded saying if you counted my pushups in the entrance and midterm tests than they should count now. I was dismissed on the final day of police academy and have to take a whole academy over again. I have no plan to retake the whole academy and I feel like quality police officers are dismissed because they dont fit the instructors cookie cutter image of a warrior police officer and the instructors can get rid of them with saying their form doesn't count on a subjective sit up or push up test. I was beyond tears and bitterly disappointed. Maybe policing is just that fucked in america.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\ncan a mod verify I went to a academy to everyone saying im lying\",\"Today I found out my raise was only 1.75%. After not getting a raise for the last 2 years I was promised that I would be getting 15% raise, but it was verbally so I have no record of it. I tried talking to my boss about it, but he kept blowing me off.  So after he left for lunch today I left my keys on his desk, clocked out and went to lunch.  I texted him that I quit effective right now.  I was doing the work of 3 people, it was not worth the stress for $49K a year.  I know it will hurt them pretty badly to lose me, and I do not have another job lined up right now, but I will start looking tomorrow.\",\"I'm 26(M) and I work at local bigbox store...sucks I know but haven't had much luck entering the career I studied for. I worked a closing shift last week and I noticed my boss having car issues and asked if he needed a ride. I drove him home and it was really awkward. He just talked about work and I get the sense it is his entire world. As I dropped him off he says \\\"Pick me up here tomorrow at 7am\\\"\\n\\nI was like \\\"yeah sure\\\" because I thought he was joking. He proceeds to tell.me his car will need to be taken to a mechanic and he needs a ride tomorrow at 7am. I reluctantly agreed. I've been driving him into work  for over a week and he has gone so far as to change my shift schedule so that I start at the same time as him everyday and get off at closing. He has me off for four hours in the middle of the shift so that I don't rack up any overtime hours!\\n\\nYesterday on while driving him  home, which is 15 minutes out of my way I asked if he could pay for some gas. He went nuts. Said that I should be glad to even have a job and that I should be grateful for being able to make a connection with someone who is in a powerful position inside the company.\\n\\nI need the job but I don't know what the heck to do.

We loved each other and had a great time together. I got a high pressure job a few years in that my bosses claimed would be worth it in the long run.\\n\\nYou know the story. I embraced the grind lifestyle. Worked late , worked weekends, worked holidays and on vacation while my wife sat around by herself. I kept telling her it was for our future and would eventually pay off. She begged me for years to quit, said she didn't care about the money. I chose wrong. \\n\\n2020 sucked for financially but I was assured by my boss that 2021 would be \\\"amazing\\\" for me. I worked every weekend. I worked the day of my wedding. We cut our honeymoon short so I could get back to work. I was chasing the pot of gold cause I wanted to buy her a house. \\n\\nWelp. 4 months post-wedding, my wife leaves me ending our 8 year relationship. She told me I always chose work over her and didn't like what I turned into.  I begged her to stay but said I just needed till the end of the year to cash out and I would quit. Nope she left. Was tired of spending her weekends alone and felt unloved. I kept my head down and threw myself into work to try to forget and maybe find some meaning in the destruction of my marriage. \\n\\nMy job fucked me on my bonus and raise. Told me it was a hard year for the firm and they couldn't pay me what they promised. My marriage ended up being worth nothing. \\n\\nI took 2 weeks off, came back for 1 week, and quit. I made sure they knew I blamed them and made sure to delete 6 months of work on the way out the door. \\n\\nFuck your job. Enjoy your weekends. Money won't buy you happiness. If you're lucky enough to find someone who loves you, focus on that and never let go.\\n\\nLearn from my mistakes reddit.\\n\\nEdit: Wow didn't expect the hate. People, I was trying to give my wife a good life. I admitted I made the wrong choice. Not looking for sympathy, trying to warn you to avoid my mistakes. For those reaching out with condolences, Thank you. For you guys telling me I fucked up, I know. Fuck you for rubbing it in. Maybe read the whole post before judging\\n\\nEdit 2: Thank you for everyone who actually read and understood my post. I'm still getting some pretty horrible messages but its like 2%, the rest of you have given me nothing but positivity and know that I deeply appreciate it. I never expected this response, I was just a drunk lonely guy in a bar when I posted it.

I\\u2019ve got about 15 years experience and the industry standard is generally that after 10 years experience in the field you receive a forth week of vacation time. I was receiving 3 weeks. \\n\\nSo I talked to a partner who i trust and he helped me write up a polite a friendly letter describing rational reasons why it made sense for me to get another week of annual vacation time.

Because I'm the lead technician, when people are being aggressive to my techs, I will step between them to resolve the issue. I don't have to do it all the time, but when I hear a particularly nasty tone or names being called, I will remove my technicians before they have to ask me to. Usually only gets that bad once a week or so. Occasionally we'll have an off day where I have to step in twice in the same day. Today, however, 3 hours into my shift, I had to step up FIVE TIMES.\\n\\nBy the 5th time, I heard things escalating and turned to my pharmacist. They are the only person above me in chain of command, so I turned to her and said \\\"I am too close to my final day for you to want me to handle this.\\\" In my defense, I gave her fair warning. But alas, my pharmacist today is terrified of confrontation and did not come to handle the situation, so I had to.\\n\\nIt was a simple problem, really. We needed updated insurance info, and my technician had told her that. The woman did not care. She was irate, she was screaming at my tech, she was walking up to every customer in our very long line to yell at them about how incompetent we are, etc, instead of giving us her fucking insurance card. \\n\\nShe gives me the card, I ask for her DOB and she flies off the handle again because we should already know it. I, still using my customer service voice, explain that I am not the person she was speaking with 2 minutes ago and that I would need her information if she wanted me to help her. While I was pulling up her profile, she continued to berate and insult me and my staff. She slammed a card down on the counter and said \\\"IS THIS THE GODDAMN MEDICARE D CARD YOU WANTED?!?\\\" I held up the card, pointed to the label in the top right corner that said Medicare Part D and said \\\"Yes, ma'am, this card labeled as such is your Medicare part D card.\\\" And I processed the claim for her.\\n\\nWhile I'm processing the claim, she keeps asking if im new here bc OBVIOUSLY i don't know what im doing. I said explained that I've worked for the company for 12 years and I have been the lead tech at this location for 3 years. She then continued to just generally talk shit, like I must work nights because I look like the kind of person who can't do mornings? And like, she's not wrong, but also, why??\\n\\nNow, it takes roughly 2 minutes to process insurance if we don't have it on file. After those 2 minutes, I told her it was no charge. She said \\\"see, that wasn't too fucking hard for you idiots to figure out, was it?\\\" I replied \\\"no, ma'am, it only took 2 minutes of PATIENCE FROM YOU, as well as YOUR INSURANCE CARD\\\" to fix. The woman was apparently not expecting to be yelled back at, asked for my name. I told her my name, and she said \\\"I DIDNT HEAR YOU, I WANT TO KNOW YOUR NAME\\\". And honestly....I snapped the fuck off. I slammed her bag on the counter, ripped my name tag off, flipped it over to the back so she could see my employee information and I shouted back MY NAME IS 'COULSON'S ROBOHAND.

I told him what I wanted and his response was \\u201cor what?\\u201d I was taken off guard by the response so I said we\\u2019ll see I guess. I then asked him why he doesn\\u2019t think I should get it. He proceeded to explain how he\\u2019d love to give everyone $100/hr but it has to be even and fair across the board. I reminded him that I\\u2019m not asking for $100/hr.\\n\\nAt my job, which is a team of 4 people including a manager, I\\u2019m the only one with knowledge of how to fully operate the production line. I\\u2019ve trained others in the past but nobody stayed long enough to do it on their own. I told the VP that it doesn\\u2019t make sense for me to be making the same as the new hire who knows nothing yet. He said that\\u2019s unrealistic. So now I had to remind him that for the last 6 months not a single finished product would\\u2019ve left the facility if it hadn\\u2019t gone through me. At this point he began to belittle me and tell me I\\u2019m not special and I\\u2019m no superstar and that anybody could do my job. I said ok, where are they then? I\\u2019m the last one left. All these other people have not lasted. He said that\\u2019s the wrong perspective to have. I asked what would you do if I wasn\\u2019t here? He said they\\u2019d figure it out. So I said I think this conversation is over you\\u2019ve made yourself clear.\\n\\nI then went out into the shop to continue prep for the days run. The manager brought me back in whereHR was now present. The VP stated as soon as I walked into the office that effective immediately my employment has been suspended. I said go fuck yourself and went to grab my keys. They all followed me out proceeding to tell me I\\u2019m handling this wrong. I approached the VP and said I asked you for a raise, to be compensated fairly and your response was to fire me? Go fuck yourself you fucking idiot.\\n\\nEDIT:\\nWow, the response has been absolutely overwhelming! I totally expected nothing to come from this post. I was really just using it as a way to recount what happened for myself, but everyone\\u2019s overall support and positivity has really turned out to be a great motivator in moving past this stupid job. I read about 2k comments yesterday and I\\u2019d like to address a couple things.\\n\\n1. YES! This really happened. It\\u2019s really not that far fetched of a story. Incompetent leadership is a plague and exists in most corporate level jobs.\\n\\n2. NO! I will not name names. Unfortunately this company sneaks in a tricky little clause in your employment contract that you won\\u2019t bad mouth the company by name. As much as I\\u2019d like to crucify them I must allow them to remain anonymous as to not end up in litigation as well as risk any UI benefits.\\n\\n3. I will be filling you all in on what happens within the next couple of weeks. While I don\\u2019t expect them to be calling me back(due to the Molotov I burned the bridge with) I do expect some other shenanigans to occur. I will keep those interested updated.\\n\\nThank you for kind words, love, and positivity. Y\\u2019all really know how to make a pawn feel like a king.\\n\\nUPDATE:\\nSo it\\u2019s been a couple weeks and I figured I\\u2019d give an update to the story for those who were interested. As expected I got no phone call from the company begging me to come back. Although that would\\u2019ve been a sweet conclusion to the whole thing, I\\u2019ve been working on just trying to put them and the experience behind me and all that would have done was brought them back to front and center of my focus and energy.

I put in 15 hour days 6 days a week, always went above and beyond, never took a day off ever, not even sick. I was the guy that you go to if you want something done and done well. \\n\\nThe team I was on expanded and we hired this useless guy who did less than the bare minimum yet always got a free pass. Guess he must have been related to someone special.\\n\\nI requested 3 days of leave for my wedding anniversary 2 months in advance, set out plans to ensure all my work would be done and they wouldn\\u2019t even notice me missing. It got approved. \\n\\nToday, 2 days before I was due to head off on leave, my boss calls me and says that he has to cancel my leave as the useless guy needs the same days off to go skiing. I explained how I\\u2019ve never once asked for a day off, I work overtime every single day, unpaid and how useless this other guy is. \\n\\nHe told me his decision is final and my leave approval has been revoked. I told him to shove it up his ass and quit on the spot. \\n\\nFuck working for assholes\\n\\nEDIT: Holy moly this blew up, was posting just to vent. First up, thank you for all the love, awards and upvotes. \\n\\nTo clarify a few points, I am in Europe so getting fired after the 6 month probation is incredibly difficult. Redundancy would cost employer 6 months of my salary. So in these cases, employers opt to make life as shit as possible for you so that you quit. \\n\\nIt's all definitely my fault as when I joined the company i gave the job 200% effort and way too much of my time. I had 0 experience or qualifications for the role so was just trying to prove they gambled right with me. This backfired massively and just showed them i'm a giant tool they can abuse and take advantage of. \\n\\nMy employer reached out to me this morning and offered me my job back and my leave approved, as well as extra leave days, more money and a slightly bigger bonus. Your wisdom and insight into the shitty atmosphere and position i've created for myself has made me realize that this would be a terrible idea, so I told him to get lost. \\n\\nI'm going to take some well deserved time off to celebrate the holidays with my family and consider starting my own business where employees and their wellbeing come before everything else. Thanks for everything guys, you've really made me see the light <3\",\"I've been at my job for a year now. In March the Assistant manager just walked out, so I stepped in and did his duties. I learned everything and my manager was training me to become the next assistant. I was getting 34-39 hours a week. \\n\\nIn September, someone complained that they weren't given the opportunity to apply, so they did job interviews and I didn't get it it went to someone in a different town and they transferred here. They expected me to train her and I said no because that's why they hired her-she knew how to order inventory and I didn't. That's the only reason why I didn't get it. \\n\\nSo anyway, they hire her give her 40 hours a week plus she started off at 22 an hour where I was making 15, I was upset but I shook it off, then from Nov-now I  only got 16 hours a week where the other person working there, not the assistant manager, got my hours. And I know it's because I said no to training her. \\n\\nToday I got my schedule and im supposed to work tomorrow + the 1st and I worked Christmas Eve and Christmas, (with no holiday pay) and was promised I would be able to have these next couple days off. My kids dad had them for Christmas and so I ensured I'd have them for new year Eve and new year's. I told my manager I wasn't coming in and she said I had to work sorry. I was pissed off all day, and the straw the broke the camel's back was I found out she intentionally scheduled herself off so she could take a 16 day vacation instead of 14. \\n\\nI've worked every fucking holiday, I worked my ass off keeping that department running on 15 dollars an hour working above and beyond what I was paid for and I asked for two days off for my kids and she took those days away from me, and didn't even bat an eye. We had a ton of orders, and I just took off my hat my badge and set them down and told her to have a good new years. Walked out and I don't regret it.\\n\\nGood luck to them tho, because if it wasn't for me coming behind her and telling her what we needed we'd never have supplies!\",\"I worked for a supermarket chain here in the US for the past three years. I busted my butt there for minimum wage so that I can pay for school. I always took extra shifts and did everything my manager asked me to do. I was a good employee and I never even had so much as a write up.\\n\\nYesterday a woman came in to the store. She came up to the customer service desk while I was helping another customer. She started to snap her fingers at me and demand my attention. Stating she was in a rush and needed help finding something immediately.\\n\\nI told her that I had to finish with the current customer first and than I would be right there to assist her. She was not too happy about it but waited until I finished. \\n\\nWhen it was her turn, I asked her what she was looking for. The woman asked me where the \\u201cchicky figs\\u201d are. \\n\\nI was confused and didn\\u2019t understand what she meant so I asked her to repeat herself but she said it the exact same way the second time. I honestly had no idea at the time what she was referring to. My mind just went blank as I have never heard someone use that terminology before.\\n\\nI asked her what that was as I was not familiar with it. That\\u2019s when she suddenly became violent. Screaming at me that I was an idiot and worthless. I tried to defuse the situation but this women just would not calm down. She was causing a huge scene that was drawing the attention of other customers. I felt that it was necessary to call for the manager and security. \\n\\nMy manager got there first. He has always been the \\u201ccustomer is always right\\u201d type. He came down and immediately asked me what I had done wrong. He apologized to her for my behavior and asked her what she wanted. He was able to figure out that she was looking for frozen chicken fingers. He gave her a free box of chicken fingers and she continued to verbally insult me. \\n\\nLater my manager said I was in the wrong. That I was being rude and condescending to the customer and I should have understood what she was asking for. I tried to defend myself and explain my side of the story but he would not listen. He said there are many college students he can hire to do my job and that I was a dime a dozen girl. I was fired and told to get off the property.\\n\\nI feel stupid now for not realizing she was asking for chicken fingers but I honestly did not understand her. I don\\u2019t understand why she couldn\\u2019t have just said it properly. I don\\u2019t understand how it is my fault that she caused a scene and scared other customers. \\n\\nNow I\\u2019m unemployed and trying to figure out what to do next. I don\\u2019t understand how the customer is always right even at the expense of a hard working employee. It just doesn\\u2019t make sense to me.\\n\\nEdit: Typos\",\"YOUR WAITRESS 'S LEGS GET A LOT OF EXERCISE ON THE JOB\\nWHEN THE REVOLUTION COMES, SHE'LL OUTRUN YOU.\\nTIP WELL.\",\"So a couple of days ago a co worker was trying to give me shit for going slow, I responded \\u201c I\\u2019m still getting everything done, this is just a job, what are they gonna do, fire me?\\u201d Apparently that really upset her and she hasn\\u2019t come in the last few days, she\\u2019s still on the schedule so I don\\u2019t think she quit.

I was the 4th person hired for the company and started working \\\"in the field\\\" and moved up to the top as the company grew.  One of the owners was a billionaire.  He had about 40k acres of cattle farm that was rich for oil.  There were hundreds if not thousands of wells already drilled on his land.  This was all family land and this guy grew up very rich well before there was oil drilled on his land. \\n\\nSo, one night my bosses (two other owners)  tell me to get in their truck we are headed over to \\\"the ranch\\\" to see the other owner.  I knew this would mean partying.  We got there, talked business for a while as a group and then drank.  We drank a lot. \\n\\nThis job was the first job I had after getting divorced and basically my ex kidnapping my daughter and moving across the country (8 years later I finally had justice in court).  It was a really good paying job for me then and I was grateful and an extremely hard worker because of that. I wanted to tell \\\"this other owner\\\" how appreciative I was.  So, went up to him and told him \\\"Hey,  I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate this opportunity and how much it has changed my life\\\" (thinking that I will soon have the financial capability of fighting for my daughter).\\n\\nHe then turns to me and says, \\\"I never want to hear you say that again, I am in this business to make money.\\\"  \\n\\nI was floored.... I didn't know what to say.  It always stuck with me over the years.  I have realized more recently the how this is how most ultra-rich people feel.  We are purely a way to make them more money.  \\n\\nI worked there another 2 years or so and then left.  I learned a lot about business from that job but I also learned unless you are that 1%, you are just a pawn for someone.\\n\\n\\nEdit:  \\n\\nFirst off, I appreciate all the support!  \\n\\nSecond,  I know now I owed him nothing but didn't understan  that at the time. I was smart, worked hard, and was lucky.  I am where I am today because of those factors.\\n\\nLastly,  I am not rich.  I live a good life but am no means rich.

Pretty large international chain. For the most part, I\\u2019m sitting in the lobby watching tv and messing around all night between my 1-2 hours of work. I don\\u2019t need this job. I just use it for extra cash so not too worried about losing it.\\n\\nWe just had some snow yesterday, and last night was pretty cold. Not negative temps, but down to about 10F. A homeless guy came up to our front door at about 2am to ask if I could look up bus and train schedules for him so he could get out of the cold. I told him to come on in and sit on the couch and chill for a bit while I look it up. Made him some hot chocolate and we chatted while I was looking for the schedules.\\n\\nThe next form of public transit coming by wasn\\u2019t until 4am. So this poor dude had 2 hours of cold to deal with before he could get on a bus. I told him he\\u2019s more than welcome to chill on our couch and watch tv until it comes. \\n\\nAt this point, i realized I could hook this dude up. We have snacks and water we give all guests checking in. I asked if he wanted a few, then when he said yes, I just dumped the whole plate of probably 50 packages of chips, nuts, cookies, etc into a bag and handed it to him.\\n\\nWe have tons of toiletries we just give out as well. I asked if he needed anything. Ended up loading his backpack up with toothbrush, toothpaste, bottles of soap, q tips, tweezers, TP, etc.\\n\\nThen I asked if he was gonna be on the bus all morning trying to stay warm. He said yeah. So I went in the back and gave him a few small towels to wash himself with and a small pillow and blanket. None of those are tracked and we\\u2019re constantly buying more to replace what gets stolen anyway.\\n\\nAll of this stuff, the company I work for buys on a regular basis and just hands it out to entitled ass members that don\\u2019t need it anyway.

I realized I was really underpaid for the area I live in too so I asked my boss for 5% since I figured this was a reasonable request and would slowly help me catch up to where I should be.  \\n\\nWell he acted super offended, reminded me that our VP sent us a care package early this year (t shirt with company logo  and snacks) so it shows the company cares about us and then turned the discussion into performance issues he suddenly has with me although my performance has never been an issue before.

For Christmas he got me a $25 AMC gift card. The closest AMC theater is 1.5hrs away in another state. That pissed me off and made me start looking for other jobs. I genuinely cared about my job and the account, so I waited to accept a job offer until I had trained someone else to do my job. When the time came, I met him in his office and told him that I had accepted another job and that I was putting in my notice, but to not worry because I have someone already trained. When I told him that I had accepted a position with another company in our field but would not be doing the same thing so it wouldn\\u2019t violate my non-compete, he called our chief legal office on speaker phone while I sat there. The CLO tells me that \\u201cI cannot even mop floors at a company in our field for at least a year\\u201d. The CLO adds HR to the call and HR tells me that since I won\\u2019t be pursuing my new job, they are going to let me work 2 more weeks to make sure the handoff goes smoothly and then I will be fired for looking for other jobs. \\n\\nThey asked me for more details as to what I would be doing at my new job, and I told them I wasn\\u2019t going to discuss it. After I left, the CLO of this company (a company who brings in $6 BILLION/year in revenue) called me randomly for the next few weeks trying to intimidate me. They even started contacting my new employer. Luckily, I don\\u2019t work for a shitty company now and the CEO got involved and told them that they would be ready to fight this in court. They stopped contacting me after that, which meant they never even planed in taking me to court. They just wanted to scare me into quitting my new job. \\n\\nFuck companies like this.

In the last two years, it seems that Karen's are increasing in number and in severity. \\n\\nDaily, we endure verbal, emotional, and sometimes physical abuse at the hands of our customers. People regularly yell at us, the underpaid employees over things out of our control. \\n\\nList of things I, or my coworkers, were yelled at for today:\\n\\n1) For not having someone's order rang in when they got to the drive through window. This person did not wait for me to greet them at the speaker box, but instead barked their order at me and sped down the drive thru lane while I was helping another guest. \\n\\n2) For not leaving the building and walking to this woman's car to take her order in the drive thru lane when she refused to roll down her window at the speaker box to order. \\n\\n3) For not taking a man's order when he tried to come in through the drive through the wrong way. He proceeded to get out of his car to order at the box. For safety reasons, we cannot permit this. He told us he would order at the window, which we also try to avoid, especially when there is a line wrapped around the building like today. He swore at us and circled the building for several minutes before leaving. \\n\\n4) For not modifying drinks for free. A woman called asking how to ring in a vanilla bean Frappuccino with an added scoop of matcha on the mobile app. We explained a few different ways to ring it in on the app. She calls back a few minutes later saying it's not working. We offered to have her come into the store and we can ring it in for her. She asked if she was going to be charged for the modification.

I\\u2019ve talked on here about how the pay was good and how good the benefits were, i REALLY enjoyed the job and the environment. Around week 1, I met the owner. It was always stressed to me how important it is to cater to the owner, let\\u2019s call him Mr. F. Mr. F, and I met while I was in a meeting with my supervisor. I greeted him, he greeted me back and that was that. Later my supervisor called me into her office and said that Mr. F would like me to stand when he entered the room, as a sign of respect and knowing his place in the business. I said ok, sure. Sounds easy enough. I tell my coworker this and she gets a scared look on her face and tells me she didn\\u2019t realize this was the new rule so she would start standing also. I feel like her reaction she have been the first red flag. Week 3 for me started Monday this week. the week was going good until Tuesday. I\\u2019m working the front lobby and I see someone pull into Mr. F\\u2019s parking spot. I\\u2019m completely alone in the building and nobody told me he was coming in today. I call my supervisor who says he shouldn\\u2019t be coming in but as she\\u2019s saying this and i\\u2019m on the phone with her, he walks in and walks past my desk. As I\\u2019m on the phone, I don\\u2019t say anything to him, my first mistake. I also don\\u2019t stand, my second and biggest mistake. I smile at him but that wasn\\u2019t nearly enough. This happened at 11am. One of my coworkers gets back and I tell her what happened. She freaks out and says while I might not lose my job, this is a big deal. I get the first call from my supervisor, I get reprimanded. My coworker, who is his personal assistant, says that Mr. F told her if I don\\u2019t greet him again, I\\u2019m gone. So he comes through the lobby again and I greet him. He leaves. I\\u2019m reprimanded again when my supervisor comes back in. Flash forward to 7pm (I get off work at 4) I get a call at home stating that what I did was so detrimental to the business that I need to not come in the next day to think about what I done. Unpaid, of course. I was livid, but it doesn\\u2019t end there. Friday morning I come in after my unpaid day off, and I\\u2019m called into my supervisors office.

Mr. F\\u2019s wife was also due to come in later that day to reprimand me also, as Mr. F does not do any of this himself.

Even when one of my employee's Grandma died and she was out of Sick Time, corporate forced me to give her \\\"points\\\", leading to a suspension. Another one of my employees was only 17 years old and was taking care of his drug addicted, PTSD-suffering Father. He couldn't make it in for 3 days due to his Father having an episode. He was out of Sick Time. So corporate forced me to give him points for each day missed. He ended up getting fired because of it.\\n\\nDespite all of my attempts at arguing and pleading with corporate, my District Manager and Area Managers wouldn't budge and I only pissed them off even more for not being a \\\"Yes Man\\\". During one of our meetings I remember our District Manager literally saying to me \\\"Why can't you just sit quiet and nod your head like everyone else\\\".\\n\\nI continued pushing the envelope, I continued to argue and push back on their policies, and the final straw was when one of my best and most trusted employees was 16 seconds late to clock-in and would have received her 3rd attendance point, leading to a write-up and 3 day suspension. (Over the years, I had given her every raise that corporate allowed me to give her. But she still lives pay-check to pay-check, so a 3-day suspension PLUS her car breaking down would really hurt her).\\n\\nSo I edited the time-clock to change her time by 16 seconds and it just so happened our Area Manager had our store's time-clock open on his laptop that morning and saw me adjustment it.\\n\\nI was fired that same day. No prior warnings, no prior HR issues, no customers complaints, no employee complaints. I understand being fired, I broke a rule, no arguments from me about it. 5 years down the drain just like that.\",\"I was working sales at a car dealership for about 6 months averaging about 75 hours a week (the norm if you want to be \\u201csuccessful\\u201d)\\n\\nIt\\u2019s almost 11pm and I\\u2019m about to leave the dealership and go home for the weekend.

It was somewhere she really wanted to work and has been going to since she was a kid. The shop owner who interviewed her acknowledged that it wasn\\u2019t a living wage and apologized that they couldn\\u2019t offer more. I realized the reason I was so surprised wasn\\u2019t just because my daughter is generally a bit shy and always non confrontational, but because this goes against the societal norms I grew up with. \\n\\nI\\u2019m 41 and when I was her age I would\\u2019ve taken any shit pay they offered me just for the experience and so I could work at my favorite shop. And I would\\u2019ve been grateful for the opportunity for them to take full advantage of me. I would\\u2019ve never had the confidence to stand up to an older adult in a position of power like that. I told her I was so proud of her for knowing her worth and not accepting anything less. \\n\\nThis sub has made me realize that we ALL have to do this. At every interview, every job. I just accepted a new position recently and now I wish I would\\u2019ve negotiated for more. I will now the first chance I get. We can no longer accept the status quo of working for less than a living wage. And not just for ourselves, but for all of us. Employers CAN pay us more and they WILL despite all their bullshit excuses that claim otherwise. But we have to force their hand, they won\\u2019t do it willingly. \\n\\nMost people think that you teach your kids, but really the learning goes both ways. And it never stops. I\\u2019m so thankful for the new perspective and for this sub. Just wanted to share. Solidarity forever.\\n\\nEdit: Wow. I did not expect this to blow up like it has, and so quickly. This is the most time I\\u2019ve spent redditting ever and I do have to step away for a bit to get some other things done. I am blown away with appreciation and gratitude for all the praise for my kid. I just showed her this and she was as well. She wanted me to express her thanks to everyone for their support. It isn\\u2019t lost on her and she will be continuing to read your comments. I could see the confidence boost on her face and we had a great talk again about the topic and the days events. She is motivated to carry on her search on these terms and is grateful for all the votes of confidence! \\n\\nMore importantly to both of us though, it is so fucking awe inspiring to see all those who share my daughter\\u2019s attitude and outlook on work, or should I say the anti work perspective. I love all the \\u201cknow your worths\\u201d and comments with a similar sentiment. This is how we change the game.\\n\\nEdit 2: When I made the first edit there were about 3k upvotes. Right now it\\u2019s over 20k and I admittedly cannot keep up with the comments whatsoever. Thank you all for your thoughtful responses, and even the not-so-thoughtful ones. The process of change starts from us sharing our opinions, and we\\u2019ll never all agree.

And has other prospects, she just really liked this particular store for the reasons I stated initially. She also does have some experience and skills relating to this retail position, so I don\\u2019t know why the broad assumption that she\\u2019s a complete noob and should be happy with anything. That kind of mentality that we should take anything we\\u2019re offered is what got us into this fucking mess. And geez, how does it go over so many heads that that is the EXACT purpose of the post?! \\n\\nAlso, her having standards and not needing to take a pay cut right now isn\\u2019t entitled. She\\u2019s very privileged in life and she is aware of this and tries her best to make decisions from this basis. There is no way to ascertain from the information I\\u2019ve provided what her life is like and how much she needs to cover the costs of living. \\n\\nAlso if I didn\\u2019t get to you, thanks for all the awards! And thank you so much to those of you who so kindly expressed their approval of my parenting skills. There are some great comments filled with solid advice down there and I wholeheartedly thank you for your words. I hope people get the chance to read them. I like to think parenting skills are ever-evolving, and I didn\\u2019t always have this outlook. Like I said, my kids have taught me a lot too. Most importantly, I don\\u2019t do it alone and wouldn\\u2019t be the person and co-parent I am today without my husband.

I think it\\u2019s incredibly meaningful that this made the front page of Reddit (I didn\\u2019t know that was a thing until I just got the notification) and I think it speaks to greater change afoot.

USERRA is basically what protects me from being fired for going to my VA appointments and such. It\\u2019s a big big deal when a employer violates it. \\n\\nThe situation: I worked for a major retailer. I won\\u2019t name them, I will call them WM. WM says they are \\u201cpro-military\\u201d they\\u2019re not. I had a VA appointment for mental health. I \\u201crequest\\u201d that day off more than three weeks off in advance (requirement was two). It\\u2019s not so much a request as it\\u2019s supposed to be guaranteed by federal law. It gets denied. I tell my boss that I\\u2019m taking that day off. He said that if I do I get fired. It was the day before the 4th of July holiday. I say that\\u2019s illegal and will have a lawyer look into it. I have my lawyer email them a copy of USERRA and WM backs down. I tell my parents this, and they said I was in the wrong. I was \\u201cholding them hostage\\u201d.\\n\\n\\nEdit: WM is anti military to the point I couldn\\u2019t have a \\u201cveteran pin\\u201d on my jacket.

I decided that I wanted the job, so I did extra work, coached new staff, worked longer days etc. You all know the deal.\\n\\n\\nSo, the job came up, and I applied for it. The application process was literally just one question stating \\\"advise why you think you would be suitable for this role\\\", so I mentioned that I am currently working in this department, have worked in a department like this for nearly 15 years, have previous management experience, stepping up and taking on extra responsibility etc. The usual stuff.\\n\\n\\nThe following week, I was told that I was not shortlisted for an interview because I didn't say enough buzz words in my application form.

How disconnected are you from reality to think you've been talking to other supervisors this whole time? A crack head with a phone number gives a better reference. Don't break your arms jerking each other off so hard thinking arbitrary references are a reason people need to stay with a Shit company.\\nAlso, billion dollar companies don't do everything in house. They hire companies like the one I worked for to feed them. For example, Lamazon previously used the USPS, they in turn hired contractors to ship packages to other facilities. It's all a big game of taking a percentage, while sub contracting the work. You never notice because the products you buy have the same store label you bought from. Never mind, the supply chain it took to get there.\\n\\nEdit 3 cont- The Fallout\\nFirst day. \\nPretty mundane. No direct contact with owners. Was told from my boss they asked if I could be bought.

Keep them.\\n\\nSecond day.\\nBuddy is offered 3 bucks more over what new place is paying, plus a hundred bucks each time he needs to travel. Not per diem, think of it as a travel bonus, but each time a trip is made. Oh, and can he also stay around to train the replacements.\\nThe replacements who also aren't certified, and fresh from school. They wanted him to pass up a much better opportunity, because the only people they could fine to accept the job offer are fresh from school. Needless to say, he declined.\\nMy boss decides to feel bad and decided the ball is in his court.

After I get heath insurance, I won't need to work anymore. What's a few more years.\\n(Proceed to fill him in on how much health insurance has changed in the past decade lol)\\n\\nThird day\\nBy this time news has spread to the rest of the company.

He found a job that pays the same for 3 days of set work, vs the current 5 days and being on call 24/7. \\nI'm selling my house boys.\\nHe gave it a lot of thought. He doesn't like anything lol. His neighborhood has changed so much, the job isn't a place he wants to stay. He decided at some point next year, he's selling his house. He's going to pursue a life on the water. I've never heard him so happy. Let me rephrase. The man has never been happy, but when he spoke, it had this calm over tone to it. Wouldn't fill me in on what the new job was, but he wants to be closer to the water, and enjoy working around the docks like he did when he was in highschool.\\n\\nNow I get a call from the owners. Ignored!\\n(If you've never ignored a call from a person in a position of power, you really need to try it :) )\\nGive a call back about an hour later. \\nWhat's is going to take to keep you? Is there anything we can do?\\n\\nMy friends at antiwork, this! I finally had the ear and undivided attention of the owner!\\n\\nBut an odd thing happened. I didn't hate the guy. As much as I wanted to rub his face in it. Just unload how much I've hated it here. I realized with that phone call, there wasn't a winner. Just a person investing his time into a business that was crumbling before him. Me, an employee just tired of trying.\\n\\nNo man, there's nothing you can do. I'm just moving on to a better opportunity. I don't hate you guys, this is something I need to do.\\n\\nThen in that same moment, compassion at all time highs, they ask if I can stay on for a few months to train the replacements.\\n(Did you hear anything, absolutely anything I just said??)\\nNope! Not training anyone, once I leave that's it. There's no way I'm traveling that much. Best of luck.\\n-click\\nThen left work.

When he was hired he was told the classes would be given in a span of three weeks.\\n\\nWhen he started, the instructor was on vacation or something so they didn't offer him the first class until about 6 weeks of him being there, all the while he's been taking *mostly* Spanish calls.  He finally took the first and second classes, but the instructor has failed to schedule the third class... for months now... and all the while my husband has been expected to take Spanish calls.   \\n\\nHe's so fed up bc he's basically been doing uncompensated labor for 8 months. His team lead and his boss brush him off, the instructor won't return his emails.   So he decided that he's no longer going to do it and started to divert all Spanish calls to another team member or voicemail. He warned his boss yesterday that if he didn't get his raise and back pay then he'd stop taking the calls and I guess they called his bluff.  \\n\\nWell the big problem for his employer is that basically all the other Spanish speakers that are not being compensated decided to do the same, a mini strike! \\n\\nAll day my husband's been on the phone w HR, his lead, his boss, his boss's boss.  Everyone calling to chew him out, or convince him to \\\"be a team player\\\" and continue taking calls without a raise. His lead saying she is totally on his side but can he do this for her as a favor (yeah right!).\\n\\nWe'll see what happens next week,  but I'm willing to bet that they WILL BE promptly paying all the Spanish speakers and giving them back pay.\",\"Come on. I don't get it and it's annoying. If you get fired from a company for a bullshit reason- EXPOSE THEM. WITH EVIDENCE, IF YOU CAN. Not doing so literally removes any liability they had. If a company treats you wrong, expose them. If they fire you for asking coworkers their pay, expose them. If they make 30billion in sales a year and pay you 11.00 an hour? EXPOSE. THEM. I simply do not understand why people REFUSE to say the company that did them wrong. You're in an anonymous Reddit profile. Plus, you're likely already fired. What are they going to do, fire you? Real change only happens if we can hold those who do wrong accountable.\\n\\nEdit: Thanks for the awards and attention. This issue has really been pissing me off lately. Even if most of the posts in this sub are fake, it's still aggravating to see so many people bitching about their working conditions, without actually taking appropriate responses to help remedy that. Especially if they're fully anon.\\n\\nEdit2: Since it's front paging and I was not expecting that, I'll clarify some more. Don't get fired over a mild discrepancy on reddit. I'm sure it happens even more than I'm aware. But if there are some serious ethical issues in your workplace, wouldn't you want people to know? 8 and some scraps an hour isn't worth that to me.\",\"This was recent, I used to work for a very popular beauty supply in America, worked there for two years with no requests because I was mostly a student at a UNI. \\n\\nFive months before I wanted to take a vacation, I tell her \\\"HEY, so my parents got me a present to go to Cancun in December and ill need these days off!\\\" -\\n\\\"Don't worry about it, when time comes I'll leave you off schedule, it seems exciting\\\"\\nI thought great, the a month before the vacation I remind her and she looked at me and told me\\n \\\"I don't know what you're talking about\\\"\\nI lost it, silently in my head and walked away to talk to my other boss and she too said, \\n\\\"I know what you requested but it's not up to me to decide it's on her.\\\"\\n2 weeks pass and I lay out my resignation and she denies it.

Wow thank you all for your support. Much appreciated!\",\"I was fired last week after reaching my limit with my boss. He\\u2019s sexist, bigoted,\\nracist and a narcissist. I\\u2019ve heard countless words of abuse over the years but have stayed with company for the sake of our health insurance and stability while trying to find something else\\u2026 Last week he (mid 40sM) asked me to decorate the office for the holidays on unpaid time. I (29F) reminded him it\\u2019s not in my job description but I will do so while on business hours. He said I should enjoy doing this. I asked how so. He replied women usually do unless their frigid. After months of these side comments I saw red, and said \\u201cthen send my regards to your wife because clearly you don\\u2019t know how women work\\u201d. He left my office without a word but I knew I just canceled my employment. \\nI took action immediately and deleted every password and saved contact I had. I worked as the office manager for 8 years and paid all the companies bills, worked with our accountant, advertising team , HR firm and payroll portal. \\n\\nOh and I was the only one in the company who knew the process for all these things. I have a very well written \\u201chow to\\u201d manual I sent to him last year with all the information to take care of this via email that he never responded to.  I BCC\\u2019d myself because I had a feeling this would happen. And I\\u2019m glad I did.\\n\\nHe fired me 2 hours later and I have had the utter delight to send him straight to voicemail 3 times now.  Fuck him and merry Christmas.\",\"Today, a well-respected worker in my company decided to call it quits.\\n\\nHe was an intelligent leader that taught many employees important lessons and skills in both technical and life. While most of us loved and respected him, HR hated his guts. He has been challenging them on every unfair rule and shady actions, and they have been very petty, toxic, and discriminative towards him for it for over half a decade.\\n\\nEarlier this week, they had a big argument regarding salary and job description. They wanted him to create a \\u201ctraining manual\\u201d for all projects, but he refused because there\\u2019s too much that goes into it. They claimed his ideas and work technically \\u201cbelongs to the company\\u201d so he offered to send them an invoice for it. Afterwards, he stormed off and HR boldly lied to us they were \\u201cletting him go despite his plead to stay.\\u201d It was an obvious load of bullshit because we all heard them yelling in the conference room. After over half a decade, it seems like HR won, but he still had one more card left.\\n\\nBefore he left, he made a small announcement saying goodbye and added a small speech about never taking disrespect from absolutely anyone. Before he officially left for good, he asked us for one last request which most of us agreed to before even knowing what it was.\\n\\nHe asked us some of us to share our wages since HR was VERY serious about keeping confidential. It wasn\\u2019t in any contracts or handbook so no one can get fired for it. A lot of us were reluctant at first, but eventually a few people shared. After the first 2-3 people, things started getting hectic. A lot of people were shocked to find out their coworkers were getting paid significantly more and wanted to know why. Thats when everybody found out that they were told completely different reasons why their wages were completely different. One person was told that their wage was lower because of their experience, while others revealed that they were told experience doesn\\u2019t matter. The whole company was in an uproar and pointing out obvious signs of sexism, discrimination, etc. When HR got back from lunch, they felt the wrath of the whole company. HR tried to turn it around on the employees who \\u201cviolated\\u201d company policy, but instead of arguing with them, a lot of people just quit on the spot. I think about 10 people from different departments left immediately, 7 turned in their 2 weeks, and God knows how many others starting looking for new jobs. For the first time in my life, I'm actually excited to go to work early Monday morning to see how this unfolds.\\n\\nMoral of story: Fuck what HR said, talk about your wages and know your worth.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nUpdate: Wow I did not realize this would blow up like that! Thank you to everybody for the insight to HR! I guess for those who are wondering;\\n\\n* My coworkers weren\\u2019t necessarily rioting in the office. The only thing that felt like it would get out of hand was when we heard yelling down the hallway. In fact, I\\u2019m sure half of those that said they \\u201cquit\\u201d will be back soon since one of our managers contacted corporate or a more upper management about it.\\n* A lot of us didn\\u2019t know how to feel about all the new information, so we kind of just sat there and listened to the ones that were voicing their opinions on it. We knew that everybody got paid a little differently, but didn\\u2019t know that only certain employees were denied/given privileges. Some of the men were allowed paternity leave, but the employee that I was talking about, wasn\\u2019t allowed that along with two other single black parents in the company, you can see how this was shocking to hear. I think what made people more upset, besides the pay differences, was that they were lied to about various things.\\n* I just recently got hired about 2 months ago so I didn\\u2019t know much about the company politics. I think the company is a great and has a great culture. My managers and coworkers always make sure I have everything I needed to be successful and HR was never a major problem to me. Although\\u2026 they did give me an offer that was way below the range they first gave me and their reasoning was because of my experience and education, others were told it was the position base salary. Found out quickly that others were told different things.\\n* A lot of people weren\\u2019t surprised about this since they knew about the tension between the two parties. Thinking back, there were a lot of signs that I missed. Like how the HR manager made a passive aggressive joke about how I shouldn\\u2019t ask \\\\[the worker I was talking about\\\\] anything because he isn\\u2019t a good employee. But I was new, so I literally took it as a joke\\n* I also didn\\u2019t really look too deep into what\\u2019s all was going on, but if everybody insists, I will try to keep an eye out and give an update on Monday or at least when something major happens. You guys really got me wanting to investigate this like I\\u2019m some big CNN reporter or whatever lmao\\n\\nUpdate 2: It was a lot to put in this post so here's a link to the update for you guys: [https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rfwttm/the\\\\_rebellious\\\\_act\\\\_against\\\\_hr\\\\_part\\\\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rfwttm/the_rebellious_act_against_hr_part_2/)\",\"I'm an older chap. Probably older than most of you around here. I used to think this sub was a bunch of commies and lefties. As I read more and more of your posts I started to rethink my situation at my job. I had been there years and couldn't move anywhere. I tried it all. I had good reviews but I just couldn't move and they wanted it that way. I did a lot of interviews and at least three times I found out the new guy was younger. It has happened to a lot of other people there as well.\\n\\nWell as chance would have it, a few weeks ago I was dicking around Indeed and I looked up a job that had my kind of qualifications and I came up with a few hits. The first one sounded like actual fun and it brought a smile to my face. \\\"Wouldn't that be crazy?\\\"\\n\\nSo for the hell of it, I applied to the job as kind of a joke and 15 minutes later they emailed me for a phone interview. I then went to a live interview and the chap understood perfectly my situation because he came from the same side of the business world as I did. When they offered me 25% more than I was making, my jaw almost dropped.\\n\\nSo, yes, today I quit my old going nowhere job. I owe it all to you guys. And yes, I was wrong.  I dont think you're all a bunch of commie lefties anymore. You are all just people trying to better yourselves and not be made slaves. Don't get stuck in a job that you \\\"like\\\" but get nowhere.  What a great way to start the year.

So, one morning I decided to do the compromise (I have a desk job in the back room of a retailer, no customer talks to me unless on the phone and all my other colleagues are dudes.) so once every two hours I head down with my hot water bottle and fill it up, also making coffees for everyone upstairs cause they have had to put up with my cramp groans and slight sobs (I wish I was joking)\\n\\nSo the third time I go down the boss comes down and says \\u201cDo you really think you\\u2019re being a team player right now?

I picked up a hammer for the first time 6 years ago (no prior experience). I was raised believing if you work hard and apply yourself you will be successful. For 2 years I learned everything that I could in the construction industry. Took my work home with me and studied on my own time to better myself. For that I was promoted to foreman. I was brought into take over a small project at a 12 building 120 unit condo complex. It started small and the Board of Directors for the HOA told me they loved my professionalism, work ethic, and ability to complete projects on time, and under budget. We won a big contract because of that small project. That was3 years ago. I have since taken over the job of foreman, superintendent, &amp; project manager. I do the billing, meetings with engineers and board members, scheduling, take off, material ordering, I even train the subs on application of new products because we didn\\u2019t have enough mid management. The project just passed $2.7M. We got a bid request for another $3M job in the same complex. All the while the board of directors telling me how appreciative they are and how they\\u2019ve gone through 5 different contractors in the years before committing to my company because of my management and  quality of work. This boosted my confidence and I went to the owners asking for the raise they promised me 1 year ago for my production. They told me \\u201cthe experience you\\u2019re gaining is far more valuable\\u201d I said you\\u2019re right. I put my resume on public, got contacted by a headhunter, just accepted an offer this week for $80k a year salary, full benefits, 28 days PTO including holidays, in the office now ( no more working from the field full in my own truck), Lap top, wifi in my truck for on the go billing when I visit the out of state projects, $80 per diem, 100% matching 401k for the first 3 years of my employment, quarterly bonus programs. The company I\\u2019m with now only pays me 40k and that\\u2019s it none of the above listed benefits. The final mail in the coffin was when the owners bragged about how much my project made in a company meeting and then denied me a Christmas bonus. I laid this offer on their desk Friday and watched their jaws hit the floor. I told the HoA board president of the project I\\u2019m running about my resignation when  they couldn\\u2019t match my the offer. His eyes got big and requested a meeting with the owners and expressed serious concern about moving forward with the new project without my involvement. They don\\u2019t have anyone to replace me and I\\u2019m not gonna lie, it feels good to hurt their pockets when I gave them everything I had for 6 years and only asked for the median project manager salary. Fuck those greedy bastards.\\n\\nEdit: a lot of people seem to think I\\u2019m lying or exaggerating so let me clarify a few things. \\n\\nI began this company as a worker ended up dating one of the owners daughters and am now engaged to marry. I\\u2019m not exaggerating about my current pay it\\u2019s $21 hourly. I fee he uses the \\u201cfamily\\u201d excuse as a reason to keep me underpaid. Dude is a classic narcissist. I\\u2019ve taken This to his business partner and he said that my soon to be father in law has sole control over my pay.  They gave me the position and responsibility of project manager without the pay, so after taxes it\\u2019s more like 33k a year. I stayed with them out of fear of the unknown. It was ultimately my fianc\\u00e9 who gave me the courage and confidence to leave. The new position I accepted is for assistant PM, not sole PM, it comes with a hefty pay increase and I am happy about that.\\n\\n2nd Edit/Update: \\n\\nI just went to my going away party, there was some animosity at first, but they took me out to a place called twin peaks and we had beers and food and heart to hearts and overall they were happy and excited  for me!! The said in the moment they were in a panic when I gave them the offer from the other company. Honestly, I was a dick about it. I regret it now. In a mixture of feeling exploited/ under appreciated, I reacted out of emotion. My heart is so full. I know every single one of us is replaceable, but these men played a big part in making me who I am today as a professional. \\n\\nI am so happy that things have gone the way they have. I\\u2019m glad my FIL\\u2019s business partner talked some sense into him and convinced him this was a good thing. They also want to take me out to a party with the rest of the employees\\u2019s not just the management, so I don\\u2019t know what to say my face hurts from smiling so much today!!

People posting screenshots of their convos with their bosses when their bosses try to get them to come in for another shift and giving their boss reasons that are *paragraphs* long.\\n\\n**Stop trying to appeal to their humanity** Not only is it cringy as fuck, it only hurts you when you say things like \\\"I'm playing paintball\\\" or \\\"I'm going to the theme park for my sister's birthday\\\".

I found out after I received my first check. I asked her about it and she said that it's because  she \\\"pays more than minimum wage, and we should be thankful\\\" and that I'm the only one complaining about not getting tips.

Let's set something straight. Yes, I did ask her for money to pay my rent, we agreed on biweekly payments which I NEVER missed. I asked her for the loan BEFORE I found out about the credit card tips so I felt obligated to stay until I finished paying her back. During the time I was there, I never got off at the time I was supposed to because my boss thought she was entitled to my time as well.  Even on my birthday I had to text her to see if she was on her way because my mother was waiting on me to go have lunch with her. After I called her out on the tips situation she got super defensive and started being super petty and trying to mucromanage me. When my son was in the ER I called to let her know I wasn't gonna be able to work, she got mad and hung up. Didn't even ask how my son was doing.

Tells the story where he was once a one man IT  band for a small firm,  covering almost everything that has a wire in it.

Oh and asking for pay rises to match the expanding skill-set  needed\\n\\nSo  after yet another complaint, he was asked to detail in writing the variety and scope of his role and responsibility which he did with enthusiasm thinking that they were finally taking him seriously.\\n\\nBut soon after that he was told that there was no need for his services as his role was being outsourced and he was being made redundant ( not fired - important later). Was understandably upset but reluctantly accepted it as a business decision and worked out his last month. The curious part was that he was never asked to do a formal hand over to the new company and they even refused to tell him the name of the outsourcing company for \\\"company confidential\\\" reasons. \\n\\nSo he  packed up and put his name forward to several job agencies. Was contacted about several but one curious one cought his eye as it was near perfect match for the job he did previously but with a very reduced pay offer. Then asked for the actual job resume and to his shock is was basically word for word his job spec that he had written for the very company that he had just left. Even down to punctuation and spelling mistakes. Blatant cut and paste. Lucky he had previously  forwarded the job spec to his own email as backup\\n\\nHe contacted an employment lawyer who took a look over  the resume and job spec and immediately took on the case \\n\\n\\nThis resulted in a meeting between them and the company. His lawyer opened the meeting by pushing two sheets  of paper across the desk -  one with the job spec and one with the advertised resume  -  saying \\\" I'm not here to argue if or how you broke redundancy  law. I'm only here to establish how much  settlement  you are prepared to offer\\\"\\n\\nThey folded within the hour. 2 years pay.

I messaged my boss to let him know that I wouldn't be coming in tomorrow as I had previously stated and he got very upset. He was telling me holidays are mandatory (even though two people in other stores got to take time off for the holidays), and that he expected me to be at the store.\\n\\nI never responded. Maybe that wasn't the right thing to do, but I don't really care. I was only being paid $10 an hour to effectively run this guy's business for him.\\n\\nFast forward to today, my second day back since Christmas (dude couldn't be bothered to fire me on Sunday I guess. Probably too busy enjoying his holiday). I'm sitting there and in walks my boss. Keep in mind, it's just me in the store at all times. I almost NEVER get any help.\\n\\nHe then proceeds to tell me we need to have a talk and that it's my job to be here and blah blah blah, just typical management shit where he tries to tear me down.

I couldn't believe it. I just laughed a little bit and said \\\"are you serious?\\\" This then set him off even MORE.

Happy holidays everyone.\\n\\nEDIT: Was just contacted by a former coworker that my old boss is threatening legal action for slander/defamation. He said he will be pursuing legal action because of some documents I signed.

I don\\u2019t drive, so made sure the shop would be accessible by public transport before accepting the interview (it would be a 30 minute train). The area manager asked me to meet at a different location (South Dublin) for the interview. My husband took the morning off work to drive me, as it\\u2019s not easy to get to by bus. The very first thing out of their mouth was \\u201cso the job is actually at this store, we lied on the job listing.

About to quit as I haven't had a break/food/water on shift since I've been working there. I have a disability that makes me need to drink a lot more water than the average person, and the business is too small (under 15 people) for me to be requesting accomodations without getting fired for it. Funny thing is is that I work in a pet store where there's water bowls and free treats all over the place for the dogs. I'm sick of getting treated less than an animal in retail.\\n\\nEdits:\\n\\nUPDATE: I QUIT. I wanted to quit when I wrote this post this morning but didn't have any employees/bosses number (just got this job) so I went in today with the plans to quit after my shift was over. I went in the back for some water and was in there for less than a minute. Came back and was yelled at saying I need to do something about stocking. I so grabbed my stuff from the back and walked out. It's rude to quit during a shift, but it's also rude to yell at someone getting yell for trying to get water. I have a second job and have decided to not get another job until I find one with decent working conditions.\\n\\nSome FAQ for now\\nI will answer comments as soon as I can log on desktop, having trouble with that so rip. I'll just write what I keep seeing a lot. I really just came on here to vent\\n\\nQ: Are you really not allowed to have water?\\n\\nA: No and yes.  Every morning I bring in my tumbler and get asked to put in the back, so I do. I am asked to stay near the register at all times, even just to watch it when there's no customer in the store. I get reprimanded/yelled at from being away from the counter wether it's to go to the bathroom or try to sneak to the back to get some water. If I had to pick one it's go to the bathroom so I don't piss myself, so everyday come home with a completely full tumbler. I had to sign an employee handbook rule that said no water behind the counter. The employee handbook also said I can go to the bathroom while there's no people in the store, it's more of other employees coming down on me for stupid little things. So yes while I'm allowed to have my own water in the building, I just have no access to it so what's the point really.\\n\\nQ: That sounds illegal\\n\\nA: It really does, doesn't it? Once again, I can bring my water I just am not allowed access to it without some sorta negative consequence. All the breaks I've been offered have been right as my shift is ending, like I'm literally heading home for the day and they say you can take a break, so so much for that. I guess they can say I was offered a break but didn't take it, but being offered 2 minutes before your shift ends shouldn't really count. \\n\\nQ: Make a disability accommodation/doctors note/etc.\\n\\nA: Well I quit now, and considering that very small businesses don't have to follow Title 1 of the ADA (you know the employees rights part) and I just got fired from another small business last week due to my health, it's pretty risky business to ask for accommodations. I've been fired/forced to resign twice in the last 6 months for disability related work issues, I can probably sue one place and win, but this is just honestly another day in the life of a disabled person. And honestly no one should have to be disabled to have water on their shift, I'm pretty sure all humans need that.\\n\\nQ: Don't quit/wait to get fired and get unemployment.\\n\\nA: I have a second job, it's my own passive income business in the music industry. It pays for all my expenses ands allows me to put money in savings so I'm good on the finance end of things. My state will not give me anything for how much I make with my music. If you're wondering why I have an awful retail job it's because of my disability. I can't drive for distances over 20 minutes and have to do very careful planning everytime I go on vacation or leave the house for more than a couple of hours to do something. I can stand around in a store all day though without problems usually, and I get severely depressed staying at home all day, so my relatives keep pushing me to get an outside job. My music experience doesn't get my anywhere in terms of interviews and since I have no degree I get stuck with caregiver jobs or retail which have been making me more depressed than just staying at home. I really don't know where to go from here honestly. \\n\\nQ: Sue them.\\n\\nA: Maybe, I barely worked there so idk how far I'll get. Based off of a lot of people's comments this sounds like a regular thing where workers aren't allowed food/water at their posts and have no way to really access them during their shifts, or just get written up for it. It's really sad how many people are stuck at jobs that deny them the most basic rights just bc they need to afford rent. I hope things get better soon. I know without my business I would still be stuck there.\\n\\nQ: What's the companies name?\\n\\nA: it's so small that'll definitely dox me. sorry y'all\",\"e-mail: nas some very serious\\nissues y'all need to address.

I was way overqualified for this entry level job, having originally applied and been turned down for a higher position that I was qualified for, and was getting paid not very much to go above and beyond and essentially do the job I had originally applied for. I still really liked my job because I had an awesome manager and coworkers which made me want to stay. \\n\\nSo when I was offered another job completely out of the blue, I had a really hard time deciding what to do. This new job pays way more and is much more in line with what I want to do, but I knew I\\u2019d miss the work environment. Still, in the end it made sense to leave. I gave my two weeks notice, even offering to stay a little longer if needed, and explained to my manager that I had really really loved working there, but this was what made sense for me and my future.\\n\\nSkip to today, my exit interview with my manager and the owner (it\\u2019s a small company so not unusual) who had avoided talking to me all week. I was asked the basic \\u201cwhat could we have done differently?\\u201d questions, to which I explained nothing, really; I just was overqualified for the job and had a much better opportunity land in my lap that would really help advance my career. I was honest and said that I knew I would really miss the work environment but this was a choice I had to make for my future. \\n\\nThis apparently set the owner off. He went on this huge long rant about how I should have told them I was considering another offer and I could have gotten a promotion if I\\u2019d asked and how he\\u2019d never had someone \\u201conly\\u201d give two weeks notice and how I had blatant disregard for the organization after how much they\\u2019d \\u201cinvested in me.\\u201d So I guess I should have known being turned down for a job I was actually qualified for was a sign that there was room for advancement?? Definitely makes sense. And he\\u2019s never gotten two weeks notice in his 20 years of business? Really?? I had offered to stay longer to my manager but he said two weeks was enough and that he was happy I found a good opportunity, which I tried to explain, but the owner just dismissed me. \\n\\nHe then went on to say how no one was going to want to hire me after seeing I didn\\u2019t stay at a job for at least a year and that \\u201cthis wasn\\u2019t the way to leave with good references.\\u201d I just don\\u2019t know what I should have done differently - I had absolutely zero evidence that negotiation was an option, and I knew they wouldn\\u2019t match a 30% raise. This wasn\\u2019t a company I had spent decades working for - his \\u201cinvestment\\u201d was absolutely nothing. \\n\\nI thought my manager would stand up for me but he just sat there, which hurt more than anything else.

Within a week I had 4 interviews and 1 offer, in two weeks I had two offers and had them making bids. \\n\\nI had plans to quit without notice, but I live on an island, and is a revolving door on my field, so I submitted plenty of notice, On November 5th, and made my last day November 24th. \\n\\nI have been copying my boss on all emails and correspondence since November 5th to ease the transition. \\n\\nToday he came into my office, and asked me what would I need to stay additional time, I said that they have to make it worth my time, he offered a full month of salary for two extra weeks, wants me to stay until December 10th. \\n\\nAll I said is I am pretty sure you guys will manage without me, the jobs pretty much run themselves as you said, and I already accepted a position starting the 29th. \\n\\nI have been thinking about it, and the amount that they offered me for two weeks, is more that what I asked for an entire year of work, all they had to do, is give me the original 6% I asked for.\",\"Not sure if this is the right place to post this but I feel like I need to share this. So on Friday 12/17, I received a phone call that morning confirming my start date for a new job that pays a few bucks more and cuts down my commute from an 1 hour each way, down to 15 minutes.  Naturally, I was ecstatic and immediately typed up my resignation letter. (Side note this place pays bi weekly with physical checks, no direct deposit.)  At the end of our shift after he hands me my check, I give him my resignation letter. After a few minutes of silence, he states \\\"I fell like you're stabbing me in the back right now.\\\" I found this bit completely hypocritical, two weeks before when I was on sick leave due to having covid symptoms (thankfully I tested negative) I noticed he was interviewing people for my position through the shared email that is on my work phone. This isn't the first time he's done this so I let it go. He asked where I was going and I told him \\\"it's none of your business, just know I'm only leaving because I received a better offer and this place offers actual benefits unlike here\\\" He became visibly upset with that reply and said \\\"I don't need your two week notice, you're fired. Turn in your work phone and keys. Pack up your shit.\\\" What really grinds my gears is while I was trying to resign in a professional manner and leave on a positive note, this man child decides to react immaturely and now I'm out of work for the remainder of the year. I guess the moral of the story is that not every employer deserves your two week notice. Don't let anyone make you feel guilty for accepting a better job offer. You have the right to do what's best for you, not someone else's business.\\n\\nEDIT: jfc wasn't expecting this to blow up. Thank you to everyone for the kind words and to the others that mentioned that wasn't exactly a professional response regarding where I was going. To answer a few questions I've seen. I'm in US, CO to be exact. I'm on a work permit through the DACA program, I'm not eligible for unemployment benefits. Even if I was I wouldn't apply as I have enough in my savings to hold me over until I start my new job. After reading through all the comments I'm just going to look at this like a vacation and recharge. I'm not going to let this situation keep me down. I hope everyone has a wonderful holiday and blessed new year!\",\"He's a general manager of a factory. The work is hard, the hours are long, and the pay fucking sucks. It has benefits, but just barely. They've tried to unionize multiple times but somehow my dad always manages to shut that down.\\n\\nMy husband is on paternity leave right now, and my dad is constantly making fun of him for it. Saying \\\"he should be a man and go back to work\\\" instead of staying home and spending time with his babies... time that he will NEVER get back.\\n\\nThen he had the audacity to gloat about firing one of his guys that just came back from paternity leave. He literally said, \\\"I found any and every reason to write him up and get him gone. Companies don't want someone taking off time for their family. Especially men.\\\"\\n\\nI'm just... I'm floored. This man is my dad. Like, I love him and everything but FUCK. I... don't think I can do it anymore. I kind of want to go no contact. I can't associate with people who think like this. What the actual fuck??? \\n\\nEDIT: Thanks for all your messages. FYI: 1) Currently in process of finding the employee my dad fired for going on pat leave. 2) If you don't have the balls to post your hate publicly, don't bother private messaging me with it. You're embarrassing yourself. 3) I didn't post this for \\\"internet points\\\". I don't even know what those are. If I can use these points to buy a new dad, then send me all the points please.\\n\\nI just wanted to thank everyone who has contributed to this subreddit, as you have changed me. I now know better because of all of you. I was brainwashed; I'll be the first to admit it. \\n\\nThanks for reading and contributing everyone.\",\"I work at Home Depot and the company is currently giving raises across the board. Yesterday our store manager had everyone meet with him one on one to discuss our specific raises, in my meeting I was never told not to discuss our raises.\\n\\nThis morning I pulled into the parking lot at work and see my friend from the service desk walking to his car.\\n\\nGot out of my car and went to say hi and he tells me he's getting sent home for the day without pay because he was discussing his pay raise.\\n\\nTurns out the store manager, who isn't in store today, heard that he was talking about the raise and called one of the ASM's and told them to send him home.\\n\\nfuck the Home Depot.\",\"I went to an interview on Monday. I live in a very small town and everyone knows each other. I did not expect this to happen but the woman who conducted the interview sat down with my current boss at lunch after and explained, in detail, exactly what was said in the interview and that I would be putting in my 2 weeks notice at my current job.\\n\\nMy boss confronted me yesterday and said she already knows I am quitting. She used quotes that I said word for word in my interview which was creepy. \\n\\nI explained in the interview that I was going to sit down with her myself and talk with her about the new job offer but this woman did that all for me. I didn't even get a chance.\\n\\nWould this be a huge red flag at a new job? I am thinking about turning down the new job because this is pissing me off. Thanks.\\n\\nEdit: Wow thanks for all the replies. I didn't think this would get so many. I also need to mention the person who interviewed me is the one I will be replacing for the position. She doesn't seem to care about overstepping boundaries since she is resigning anyway.\\n\\nEdit: I am in the US. I doubt this is a federal crime but these two go to church together and sat down for lunch to discuss the interview on a Monday afternoon 3 hours after it was over. I don't think it is worth the money to sue since the court system in this town is a joke. The lawyers are all friends with the judge and it trickles down into small businesses.\\n\\nEdit: Spoke with a lawyer. This is NOT illegal.\\n\\nUPDATE: Reported the incident to her superior, he wants to talk to me in detail about what she did. My boss is upset I reported her. I am going to have to quit my current job.

That's why I am deeply troubled by reports of Kellogg's plans to permanently replace striking workers from the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International during their ongoing collective bargaining negotiations. Permanently replacing striking workers is an existential attack on the union and its members' jobs and livelihoods. I have long opposed permanent striker replacements andI strongly support legislation that would ban that practice. And such action undermines the critical role collective bargaining plays in providing workers a voice and the opportunity to improve their lives while contributing fully to their employer's success. Unions built the middle class of this country. My unyielding support for unions includes support for collective bargaining, and I will aggressively defend both. I urge employers and unions to commit fully to the challenging task of working out their differences at the haroainino table in a manner that fairlv advances both nartieg' interests\",\"Trumbull Dad\\n@HiddenJules\\nThe fact that the Kelloggs scabs are\\nbreaking machinery and productivity\\nis way down just proves that unskilled\\nlabor doesn't exist and perpetuating\\nthat narrative is only used as an\\nexcuse to pay people less than they\\ndeserve\",\"Full ob Description\\nKellogg's is Now Pre-Hiring for Strike\\nReplacement Workers\\nOur ready-to-eat (RTEc) cereal production\\nfacilities in Battle Creek, MI, Lancaster, PA,\\nMemphis, TN and Omaha, NE are pre-hiring for\\nHourly Production Employees.

No one should have a job opportunity stripped from them because the oligarchy is using our deeply corrupt Justice system to ruin new opportunities for you. This is a deeply disturbing precedent happening. It won\\u2019t just be healthcare workers. It will be every business that claims they *need staff to remain afloat* all of this while they make record profits and pay nothing to their staff.\",\"For a short while last year, I worked as a team lead for one of the app development teams for one of the food delivery apps. The entire team had been working from home since the start of the pandemic and had had a bunch of remote-only people join, so they were spread across several time zones, but we made it work because we thought this was how things were going to be going forward.\\n\\nAfter making several billion dollars from people like us working from home and ordering delivery, around the end of summer, the entire C-suite decided that COVID was pretty much over (spoiler: it definitely wasn't and all my people knew it) and that we would all be heading back to the office part time, gradually increasing to full time. Now, this place had pretty high turnover, so most of us had never been to any of the offices since we had been hired. We had been told when we were hired that any return to work policy would be super flexible and it turned out it really wasn't. Moreover, those in cities without an office, even though they were hired as remote workers, were expected to come up with a 1-year plan about how they were going to move without any assistance or compensation to a city with an office.\\n\\nNeedless to say, my team and many others lost their collective shit over this new policy. So the CEO started doing town halls with the other executives to pump the \\\"collaboration\\\" and \\\"team-building\\\" aspects of being back in the office. During one of the Q&A sessions, someone finally asked something like \\\"I was hired remote and I don't live in a city with an office. I don't want to uproot my family. Will you make exceptions for people like me?\\\". To which the CEO replied \\\"Look. This is what we're doing and what we think is best for the company. If you want to work from home, my suggestion is to go work somewhere else\\\". \\n\\nWhat happened next was the digital equivalent of the air being let out of a balloon. The company slack channel conversations ground to a halt and became virtual ghost towns, going from spirited conversations to the bare minimum of functional courtesies. The attendance at company-wide meetings fell by half and within a month, there was a veritable flurry of resignations, including mine. Prior to this debacle, we had already been paid below market rates, so this Fuck You from the CEO was just the match being lit on an already pretty sizable tank of gas. \\n\\nBy the time I left, the team that started at 8 people was down to just 2 deciding to stay. And six months later, word is they are still trying to find people and resorting to making QA people into app developers just to try to keep things going. As for me - I got a 50% pay bump for less responsibilities and work just a few hours a day instead of tons of unpaid overtime trying to put out fires at that old shitshow.\",\"I've seen a few posts here from people saying they're going to lose their\\u00a0jobs because they won't get the vaccine.\\u00a0\\n\\n**Your decision not to get vaccinated has nothing\\u00a0to do with anti-work.**\\n\\nYou're getting fired because you could be carrying a virus that has killed ~~hundreds of thousands~~ of people and you can't see past yourself.

Some of these problems are new and some are cracks that are just now being exposed. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n1. We all know that hospitals are at capacity every time there is a COVID spike. It is no secret: we've seen crisis mode happen in Seattle, NYC, Jackson MS, etc etc. during bad spikes. Now it is becoming more widespread and less dependent on COVID spikes. Entire cities with full hospitals before this spike started, hospitals being so understaffed that they can't use all their beds, difficulty getting patients out of the hospital because rehab facilities can't take more patients. The problems go on. Now COVID is spiking again and these hospitals that are already near capacity are going to break. [https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/hospital-utilization](https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/hospital-utilization) Just go click around your local location and see how bad it is. Make sure to focus on larger cities in your state where your trauma centers are; that tells the real picture. A lot of hospital systems have gone to a [Hub and spoke model](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5751794/), which means the sickest patients get shipped to the bigger cities ON TOP OF them serving their own population. States with 1-2 large cities see the effects of this more.\\n2. We have a severe nursing shortage. So many hospitals cannot run at 100% bed capacity because they simply don't have the nurses. This is multifactorial but it can be summed up by saying that bedside nurses are underappreciated and underpaid. For the past 10-20 years it has been more profitable for people to earn their NP degree and leave bedside nursing. There have also been a lot of paths into nursing administration and education that didn't exist before which also takes from bedside nursing. The merit of having more NPs, educators, and administrators is a \\\\*hotly\\\\* debated issue and I won't dive into it here as it is outside the scope of this post. Regardless, it means there are less bedside nurses to run hospitals at full capacity. \\n3. Because of this nursing shortage, travel nursing has taken off. The \\\\*only\\\\* good thing about travel nursing is that nurses are getting their bag. They deserve the money after working frontline during COVID. The problem with this is that it's only temporary. Hospitals have decided it will cost them less money to pay outrageous rates for travel nursing in the short term than to just give raises across the board to retain their own employees. Seriously, they would rather pay travelers 5k a week (sometimes up to 10k during surge pricing!) + whatever they pay the travel agencies instead of giving a $5-10/hour raise across the board to retain their own nurses! They are expecting things to go back to normal and it just isn't. Not to mention travel nursing likely provides worse care as you are constantly cycling people into your hospital that has to learn your protocols and system + they have abbreviated training periods. Also who wants to train someone making 3x what they make?? It is madness.\\n4. Resident physicians are being more abused than ever. For this to make sense you need a little background. The amount of residency positions (which doctors have to complete before they can practice independently in this country) is paid for by Medicare, so congress more or less controls the number of available spots. The end of 2020 added 1k spots which was the first time they've expanded spots in [25 years](https://www.aamc.org/advocacy-policy/washington-highlights/congress-passes-fy-2021-spending-bill-increases-research-health-programs). So the physician shortage is more or less manufactured, and their unwillingness to expand spots even moderately every 5-10 years put us in a horrible position. To add to this, residents are [exempt from anti-trust laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jung_v._Association_of_American_Medical_Colleges) which gives us little to no power over our situation. We HAVE to complete residency and we have little control over how it happens unless you are an absolute rock star medical student at a top school.\\n5. Residents are locked into residencies, making a set 50-60k a year with no bonuses or hazard pay during this time. COVID has not only interrupted education, but many programs (not all, there are some programs that really defend their residents) have used their residents as a COVID workforce to keep their hospitals running. When it was all hands on deck at the beginning of 2020, every specialty (including surgery, psychiatrists, etc.) were pulled to the hospital floors to care for COVID patients. I think most people were happy to help temporarily. Some programs have never stopped this and pull people off electives or from other specialties any time there is a spike. Residents make hospitals \\\\*a lot of money\\\\*, and some hospital systems can't even function without them. Case in point, the University of New Mexico neurosurgery program lost accreditation and had to hire a few doctors and 19 NP/PAs (several million in yearly salaries) to replace their \\\\~10 residents. Now that they have COVID as an excuse, residents and fellows are being used wherever the hospital needs them and there's nothing residents can do as we have to finish residency, so you play by the rules.\\n6. Now that Omicron is super infectious, all these shortages are being amplified as people have to miss work for quarantine. Even before the CDC announced 5 day quarantine + 5 day masking, it was recommended that healthcare workers could return after 7 days. A large healthcare outbreak amongst workers could be the final straw for some hospitals. Other hospitals are already broken. Healthcare will never be the same after this pandemic. So many flaws have been exposed in our healthcare infrastructure but profit remains the most important thing. Just remember, insurance companies have had [record profits](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/aug/06/us-healthcare-insurance-covid-19-coronavirus) during the pandemic. I am deeply concerned about the state of healthcare in this country and you should be too, as we ALL rely on a functioning healthcare system for our health needs.\\n\\nEdit: sorry to all the PT, OT, pharmacy staff, EMS, healthcare IT, custodial staff, lab technicians, and every one else I didn\\u2019t include. I only spoke to what I knew but knew I couldn\\u2019t be comprehensive. There are some AWESOME comments explaining how every corner of healthcare is hurting right now.
